### 4.2.1 Detailed Process Description

*   **Water Generation (RO + EDI + WFI Still)**:
    *   **Detailed Technical Description**: The water generation process is a multi-stage process designed to produce Water for Injection (WFI), which is a critical raw material for parenteral products. The process begins with raw water, which typically undergoes pre-treatment to remove suspended solids, chlorine, and other impurities. This pre-treated water then passes through a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system. RO uses a semi-permeable membrane to separate water molecules from dissolved salts, minerals, and organic compounds, using high pressure. The permeate (purified water) from the RO system is then fed to an Electrodeionization (EDI) unit. EDI is an electrically driven process that uses ion-exchange membranes and electric current to remove remaining ionic contaminants from the water. The EDI system typically produces water with a resistivity of 18 MΩ.cm. Finally, the EDI water is fed to a Water for Injection (WFI) still. The WFI still is a multi-effect distillation system that uses heat to evaporate and condense the water, further purifying it and removing any remaining non-ionic contaminants, pyrogens, and microorganisms. The WFI produced meets the stringent requirements of pharmacopoeial standards.
    *   **Principles of Operation**: RO operates based on the principle of reverse osmosis, where pressure is applied to overcome the osmotic pressure and force water through a semi-permeable membrane, leaving behind dissolved impurities. EDI utilizes ion-exchange resins and an electric field to continuously regenerate the resins and remove ions from the water. WFI stills use the principle of distillation, where water is evaporated and then condensed, leaving behind impurities with higher boiling points.
    *   **Water Usage**: This stage uses raw water as input. The RO system typically has a recovery rate of 60-75%, meaning that 25-40% of the raw water is rejected as concentrate, which contains the impurities removed from the water. The WFI still also requires cooling water for condensation. The quality of water required at each stage increases: pre-treated water for RO, RO permeate for EDI, and EDI permeate for WFI still. Wastage points include the RO concentrate stream, cooling water blowdown from the WFI still, and occasional flushing of the RO membranes and EDI modules. The approximate consumption can be 50,000 liters of raw water for WFI production of 25,000 Litres per day.
    *   **Critical Process Parameters**: For RO, critical parameters include feed water pressure (e.g., 200-400 psi), feed water temperature (e.g., 20-30°C), and membrane integrity. For EDI, critical parameters include voltage (e.g., 200-400 V), current (e.g., 5-10 amps), and feed water conductivity (e.g., <20 µS/cm). For WFI stills, critical parameters include steam pressure (e.g., 2-3 bar), feed water flow rate, and condensate temperature (e.g., >80°C). Maintaining optimal temperature and pressure is critical to water efficiency and product quality.

*   **Formulation (SS316L Mixing Tanks with Agitators)**:
    *   **Detailed Technical Description**: The formulation stage involves accurately weighing and mixing various ingredients, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), excipients, and WFI, according to a pre-defined formula. This is typically carried out in stainless steel (SS316L) mixing tanks equipped with agitators to ensure homogeneous mixing. The tanks are designed to be easily cleaned and sanitized. Weighing balances with high accuracy are used to measure the ingredients. The pH and conductivity of the solution are monitored and adjusted as necessary using pH meters and conductivity meters. The mixing process is carefully controlled to prevent contamination and ensure product quality. The entire formulation process is carried out in a controlled environment (e.g., cleanroom) to minimize the risk of microbial contamination.
    *   **Principles of Operation**: Mixing tanks utilize impellers or agitators to create turbulent flow, which promotes the uniform distribution of ingredients throughout the solution. Weighing balances operate based on the principle of load cells, which convert the force of the weight into an electrical signal. pH meters measure the hydrogen ion concentration in the solution using an electrode. Conductivity meters measure the ability of the solution to conduct electricity, which is related to the concentration of ions in the solution.
    *   **Water Usage**: This stage primarily uses WFI as a solvent or diluent. The quantity of WFI used depends on the formulation and the batch size. Water is also used for cleaning and sanitizing the mixing tanks and associated equipment between batches. The quality of water used for cleaning should be at least purified water (obtained from RO or EDI) and for product formulation, WFI must be used. Wastage points include the water used for cleaning, which may contain residual product. Proper cleaning validation procedures are essential to minimize water usage and ensure product safety.
    *   **Critical Process Parameters**: Critical parameters include mixing speed (e.g., 50-100 rpm), mixing time (e.g., 30-60 minutes), temperature (e.g., 20-25°C), pH (as per formulation requirements), and conductivity (as per formulation requirements). Maintaining optimal mixing speed and time ensures that all ingredients are properly dissolved and dispersed. Temperature control is important for preventing degradation of APIs. pH and conductivity are critical quality attributes that must be within specified limits.

*   **Filling (FFS Machine, Aseptic Filling Machine)**:
    *   **Detailed Technical Description**: The filling stage involves aseptically filling the formulated solution into sterile containers (bags, vials, ampoules, or bottles). For IV fluids, Form-Fill-Seal (FFS) technology is used, which is a continuous process that forms the container from a plastic film, fills it with the sterile solution, and seals it in a single, automated operation. The FFS machine operates in a sterile environment (e.g., isolator) to prevent contamination. For injectables and eye drops, aseptic filling machines are used, which fill pre-sterilized vials, ampoules, or bottles under aseptic conditions. The filling process is carefully controlled to ensure accurate dosing and prevent contamination. The filled containers are then sealed to maintain sterility.
    *   **Principles of Operation**: FFS machines use heat and pressure to form the container from a plastic film. Aseptic filling machines use pumps or gravity to deliver a precise volume of solution into the container. Both types of machines operate under laminar airflow to minimize the risk of airborne contamination.
    *   **Water Usage**: This stage does not directly use water in the filling process itself. However, water is used for cleaning and sanitizing the filling machines and associated equipment before and after each batch. The quality of water used for cleaning should be at least purified water, with WFI preferred for critical surfaces. Water is also used in the validation of the cleaning process. Wastage points include the water used for cleaning, which may contain residual product. Efficient cleaning procedures and proper cleaning validation are essential to minimize water usage.
    *   **Critical Process Parameters**: Critical parameters include filling volume accuracy (e.g., ±1%), filling speed (e.g., containers per minute), air quality (e.g., ISO Class 5), and temperature (e.g., 20-25°C). Accurate filling volume ensures that patients receive the correct dose of medication. Maintaining aseptic conditions is crucial to prevent contamination. Proper temperature control is important for preventing degradation of the product.

*   **Sterilization (Autoclave, Dry Heat Sterilizer)**:
    *   **Detailed Technical Description**: The sterilization stage is crucial for ensuring that the final product is sterile and free from viable microorganisms. Depending on the product and container type, either autoclave (steam sterilization) or dry heat sterilization is used. Autoclaving is used for products that are heat-stable and packaged in containers that can withstand the high pressure and temperature of steam. Autoclaves use saturated steam under pressure to kill microorganisms. Dry heat sterilization is used for products that are sensitive to moisture, such as oils and powders. Dry heat sterilizers use hot air to kill microorganisms. The sterilization process is carefully validated to ensure that it is effective at killing all microorganisms.
    *   **Principles of Operation**: Autoclaves operate based on the principle that saturated steam at a high temperature (e.g., 121°C or 134°C) is a highly effective sterilizing agent. The steam penetrates the product and kills microorganisms by denaturing their proteins. Dry heat sterilizers operate based on the principle that high temperatures (e.g., 160°C to 180°C) can kill microorganisms by oxidation and dehydration.
    *   **Water Usage**: Autoclaves use large quantities of water to generate steam. The quality of water used should be at least purified water. Water is also used for cooling the autoclave after the sterilization cycle. Wastage points include the condensate from the steam, which may contain residual product or cleaning agents. Efficient steam generation and recovery systems can help to minimize water usage.
    *   **Critical Process Parameters**: Critical parameters for autoclaving include temperature (e.g., 121°C or 134°C), pressure (e.g., 15 psi or 30 psi), and sterilization time (e.g., 15-30 minutes). Critical parameters for dry heat sterilization include temperature (e.g., 160°C to 180°C) and sterilization time (e.g., 2-4 hours). These parameters are carefully validated to ensure that the sterilization process is effective at killing all microorganisms.

*   **Inspection (Visual Inspection, Automated Inspection System)**:
    *   **Detailed Technical Description**: The inspection stage involves visually inspecting the sterilized containers for defects such as cracks, leaks, particulate matter, and incorrect fill volume. Visual inspection is typically performed by trained personnel using magnifying glasses and bright lighting. Automated inspection systems can also be used to detect defects more efficiently and reliably. These systems use cameras and image processing software to identify defects. Containers that fail the inspection are rejected.
    *   **Principles of Operation**: Visual inspection relies on the human eye to detect defects. Automated inspection systems use cameras to capture images of the containers and image processing software to analyze the images and identify defects.
    *   **Water Usage**: This stage does not directly use water.
    *   **Critical Process Parameters**: Critical parameters include lighting intensity, magnification, and inspector training. For automated inspection systems, critical parameters include camera resolution, image processing algorithms, and defect detection sensitivity.

*   **Packaging (Blister Packing Machine, Labeling Machine, Carton Packing Machine)**:
    *   **Detailed Technical Description**: The packaging stage involves packaging the inspected containers into appropriate packaging materials, such as blister packs, cartons, and shipping boxes. Blister packing machines are used to create individual blister packs for each container. Labeling machines are used to apply labels to the containers or packaging materials. Carton packing machines are used to pack the containers into cartons. The packaging process is carefully controlled to protect the product from damage and contamination during storage and transportation.
    *   **Principles of Operation**: Blister packing machines use heat and pressure to form a plastic blister around each container. Labeling machines use adhesive to apply labels to the containers or packaging materials. Carton packing machines use mechanical arms or belts to pack the containers into cartons.
    *   **Water Usage**: This stage does not directly use water.
    *   **Critical Process Parameters**: Critical parameters include packaging material quality, sealing temperature, labeling accuracy, and carton packing efficiency.

### 4.5 Details of Available Advanced Water Efficient Technologies

Several advanced water-efficient technologies are relevant to the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in the context of parenteral manufacturing:

*   **Advanced Membrane Filtration**: This includes technologies like ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), and membrane bioreactors (MBRs). These technologies can be used to treat wastewater from various processes, such as cleaning and sanitization, and recover water for reuse. UF and NF can remove a wide range of contaminants, including suspended solids, organic matter, and dissolved salts. MBRs combine membrane filtration with biological treatment, providing a highly efficient and compact wastewater treatment solution. These processes will reduce raw water intake.
*   **Vapor Compression Distillation (VCD)**: An alternative to traditional multi-effect distillation for WFI production. VCD uses mechanical compression to increase the temperature and pressure of the steam, which reduces energy consumption and improves water recovery. This technology can significantly reduce the amount of cooling water required for WFI production.
*   **Electrodeionization (EDI) with Enhanced Pre-treatment**: EDI is already in use but optimizing the pre-treatment process can improve the efficiency and lifespan of the EDI modules. This can include using advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) to remove organic contaminants that can foul the EDI membranes.
*   **Closed-Loop Cooling Systems**: Implementing closed-loop cooling systems for equipment like autoclaves and chillers can significantly reduce water consumption. In a closed-loop system, the cooling water is recirculated and cooled using a cooling tower or chiller, rather than being discharged after a single pass.
*   **Smart Water Management Systems**: These systems use sensors, data analytics, and automation to monitor water usage, detect leaks, and optimize water consumption. They can provide real-time information on water flows, pressures, and quality, allowing for proactive management of water resources.
*   **Vacuum Distillation**: This technology operates at lower temperatures than traditional distillation, reducing energy consumption and minimizing the risk of product degradation. It can be used to concentrate waste streams and recover valuable resources.
*   **Forward Osmosis (FO)**: This technology uses a semi-permeable membrane to separate water from a feed solution using an osmotic pressure gradient. FO can be used to treat wastewater and recover water for reuse, particularly in applications where high concentrations of dissolved solids are present.
*   **Rainwater Harvesting**: Collecting and storing rainwater for non-potable uses, such as cooling tower makeup and landscape irrigation, can reduce the demand for municipal water.
*   **Optimized Cleaning Procedures**: Implementing efficient cleaning procedures, such as using low-volume, high-pressure cleaning systems and optimizing cleaning cycles, can reduce water consumption in cleaning and sanitization processes.

*   **Process Effluent Treatment and Recycling**: The specific technologies used for process effluent treatment and recycling are not provided. However, typical ZLD systems for pharmaceutical plants involve a combination of technologies such as:
    *   **Pre-treatment**: To remove suspended solids, oil, and grease.
    *   **Reverse Osmosis (RO)**: To remove dissolved salts and organic matter.
    *   **Evaporation**: To concentrate the remaining brine.
    *   **Crystallization**: To recover solid salts from the brine.
*   **Domestic Sewage Treatment and Reuse**: The treated domestic sewage is currently used for gardening. The treatment process should ensure that the water meets the required quality standards for irrigation, as per regulations and guidelines of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs).
*   **Further ZLD Implementation**: To achieve full ZLD, the plant would need to address the following:
    *   **RO Reject Management**: The RO reject stream from the water generation process needs to be treated and either reused or evaporated to dryness.
    *   **Cooling Tower Blowdown**: The cooling tower blowdown stream, which contains high concentrations of dissolved solids, needs to be treated and either reused or evaporated to dryness.
    *   **Cleaning and Sanitization Wastewater**: The wastewater from cleaning and sanitization processes needs to be treated and either reused or evaporated to dryness.
    *   **Solid Waste Disposal**: The solid waste generated from the ZLD system, such as salts and sludge, needs to be disposed of properly in accordance with environmental regulations.

The feasibility of implementing full ZLD will depend on factors such as the cost of the necessary equipment, the availability of space, and the environmental regulations in the region. A detailed feasibility study should be conducted to assess the technical and economic viability of full ZLD. Implementation of a full ZLD will require significant capital investment but the long-term environmental and economic benefits can be substantial, including reduced water consumption, reduced wastewater discharge, and improved compliance with environmental regulations.

### Chapter 5: Assessment of Present Water Usage Including Recycling

### 5.1 Assessment of Present Water Usage

*   **a) Sources of Water**:

The primary source of water for the facility is groundwater, extracted through two borewells, designated as BW-1 and BW-2. These borewells are drilled to a depth of approximately 150-160 meters. No surface water sources have been identified within a 5 km radius of the facility. Reliance on groundwater necessitates careful monitoring and management to ensure sustainability and compliance with relevant regulations such as those stipulated by the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) and state-level groundwater acts. Details of the borewells, including their location coordinates, pumping capacities, and operational schedules, are maintained in the facility's water management records, as required under CGWA guidelines. Periodic hydrogeological studies should be conducted to assess the long-term impact of groundwater extraction on the aquifer. This assessment also forms the basis of reporting on water usage under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The sources of water is shown in the image below.

### 6.3 Gap Analysis and Recommendations

Based on the assessment, gaps exist in WFI generation technology and potential areas for improvement in the utilities.

**6.3.1 WFI Generation Technology:**

*   **Gap:** The industry uses double pass RO and multi-column distillation for WFI. While RO is a component of the Cold WFI system (BAT), the use of multi-column distillation is energy-intensive compared to the full Cold WFI system, which incorporates electrodeionization (EDI), ultrafiltration, and UV sterilization.

*   **Detailed Technical Comparison:**

    *   **Multi-Column Distillation:** Multi-column distillation uses heat to evaporate and condense water multiple times, removing impurities. It's a well-established technology, but its energy consumption is significant due to the phase change involved. The process involves significant thermal losses in the form of latent heat being released into the environment. Older multi-effect distillation (MED) units may also suffer from scaling, requiring chemical cleaning and downtime.

    *   **Cold WFI System (Membrane-Based):** This system combines several technologies to purify water.

        *   **Reverse Osmosis (RO):** RO uses pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane, separating it from dissolved salts, minerals, and organic matter. Double pass RO enhances removal efficiency.
        *   **Electrodeionization (EDI):** EDI uses electricity to remove ionized species from water. It doesn't require chemical regeneration, unlike ion exchange resins, and provides a continuous supply of high-purity water.
        *   **Ultrafiltration (UF):** UF removes larger particles and macromolecules, such as colloids and pyrogens.
        *   **UV Sterilization:** UV light inactivates microorganisms by damaging their DNA.

    *   **Technical Superiority of Cold WFI:** The membrane-based cold WFI system offers several advantages:

        *   **Lower Energy Consumption:** EDI consumes significantly less energy than multi-column distillation, as it directly removes ions without phase change.
        *   **Higher Purity:** The combination of RO, EDI, UF, and UV provides a higher level of purity and sterility compared to distillation alone.
        *   **Reduced Chemical Usage:** EDI eliminates the need for chemical regeneration of ion exchange resins, reducing chemical waste.
        *   **Continuous Operation:** EDI provides a continuous supply of WFI, unlike distillation, which may require batch operation.

*   **Inefficiencies of the Current System:** The use of multi-column distillation results in higher energy consumption, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and a larger carbon footprint. Also, the risk of pyrogen contamination may be slightly elevated if distillation is not meticulously controlled.

*   **Recommendations:**

    *   **Conduct an Energy Audit:** Perform a detailed energy audit of the WFI generation process to quantify the energy consumption of the multi-column distillation system.
    *   **Evaluate Cold WFI System Retrofit:** Evaluate the feasibility of retrofitting the existing system with EDI, UF, and UV sterilization components to create a full Cold WFI system. This would reduce energy consumption, improve water purity, and reduce chemical usage. The evaluation should include a cost-benefit analysis comparing the capital investment with the long-term energy savings and operational cost reductions.
    *   **Regular Maintenance:** Ensure that the multi-column distillation system is properly maintained to minimize energy losses and prevent scaling.
    *    **Pyrogen Testing:** Regularly test the WFI produced by the distillation system for pyrogens to ensure that it meets the required purity standards. Implement a robust pyrogen monitoring program.
    *   **Implement Continuous Monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring of critical water quality parameters such as conductivity, TOC, and microbial load.

**6.3.2 FFS Machine Monitoring:**

*   **Gap:** While the industry uses automatic FFS machines (aligned with BAT), the degree of automation, environmental control, and water usage in the cleaning process are unknown based on the provided data. The absence of isolator and RABS (Restricted Access Barrier Systems) also constitutes a potential gap.

*   **Detailed Technical Comparison:**

    *   **FFS machines with Basic Automation:** Earlier generations of automatic FFS machines might have limited automation and manual intervention during certain stages of the process, thereby exposing the product to potential contamination. Cleaning might also involve manual processes consuming more water.

    *   **Advanced FFS machines with Isolators/RABS:** Fully automated FFS machines coupled with isolators or RABS offer a closed and sterile environment that minimizes human intervention, reduces the risk of contamination, and ensures a higher level of product quality. CIP (Clean-In-Place) and SIP (Sterilize-In-Place) systems are integral to these advanced systems, ensuring efficient and validated cleaning using minimal water and energy.

*   **Inefficiencies of the Current System:** The industry needs to provide information about water usage of the current cleaning process of the FFS system.

*   **Recommendations:**

    *   **Water Usage Analysis:** The water audit team needs to get water consumption data during cleaning of the existing system.
    *   **Assess FFS Machine Automation and Environmental Control:** Conduct a detailed assessment of the automation level and environmental control of the existing FFS machines. Determine if they incorporate isolators or RABS. Assess the cleaning processes and water usage.
    *   **CIP/SIP Implementation:** If CIP/SIP systems are not already in place, evaluate the feasibility of implementing them.
    *   **Upgrade to Advanced FFS Machines:** If the existing FFS machines are outdated or lack adequate environmental control, consider upgrading to advanced FFS machines with integrated isolators or RABS and CIP/SIP systems.
    *   **Operator Training:** Provide comprehensive training to operators on the proper operation and maintenance of the FFS machines and environmental control systems.
    *   **Aseptic Process Validation:** Ensure that the aseptic processes are thoroughly validated according to regulatory requirements.

**6.3.3 Utility Optimization (Data Not Available):**

Since detailed data on cooling towers, boilers, and other utilities is not available, a comprehensive gap analysis cannot be performed for these areas.

*   **Recommendations (Pending Data Availability):**
    *   **Data Collection:** Collect detailed data on the type, capacity, age, and operating parameters of all utilities, including cooling towers, boilers, compressed air systems, and vacuum systems. This data should include water consumption, energy consumption, chemical usage, and maintenance records.
    *   **Benchmarking:** Benchmark the performance of the utilities against industry best practices and performance indicators.
    *   **Efficiency Assessment:** Conduct a detailed efficiency assessment of each utility system to identify areas for improvement. This should include evaluating the efficiency of cooling towers, boilers, pumps, fans, and other equipment.
    *   **Water Loss Audit:** Perform a water loss audit to identify and quantify water losses in the utility systems, such as leaks, evaporation, and blowdown.
    *   **Technology Upgrade Evaluation:** Evaluate the feasibility of upgrading to more efficient technologies, such as hybrid cooling towers, high-efficiency boilers, variable frequency drives (VFDs) on pumps and fans, and automated blowdown control systems.

### 7.3 Disposal / Discharge / Recycling / Reuse of treated waste water

The unit has installed ETP and STP for recycling and reuse of treated waste water.

### 7.4 Description of Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP)

The Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) at this facility is designed to treat industrial wastewater generated from various processes. The ETP utilizes a multi-stage treatment process, combining physical, chemical, and biological methods, followed by tertiary treatment to ensure the treated effluent meets the required discharge standards and is suitable for reuse. The plant has a capacity of 100 KLD. The detailed description of each stage is provided below:

1.  **Collection & Equalization**:

    *   **Principle**: The initial stage involves collecting the industrial wastewater from various sources within the facility. The collected wastewater is then directed to an equalization tank. The primary principle of the equalization tank is to dampen flow rate and pollutant concentration fluctuations, providing a consistent feed to the downstream treatment units. This reduces shock loading, improves the stability and efficiency of biological treatment, and optimizes chemical usage. The equalization tank also allows for the settling of some heavier solids.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the equalization tank is critical. Typical design parameters include a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 12-24 hours to effectively buffer variations in flow and pollutant load. The tank volume is calculated based on the anticipated peak flow rate and the required HRT. Aeration is often provided to prevent the settling of solids and the development of anaerobic conditions, which can lead to odor issues. The mixing intensity should be sufficient to maintain solids in suspension but not so high as to disrupt settling. A length-to-width ratio between 1:1 and 3:1 is common to facilitate proper mixing. Level controls are implemented to manage the water level and prevent overflow.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the wastewater is collected from different process units through a network of pipelines and channels. The equalization tank is equipped with surface aerators and mixers to maintain a homogeneous mixture and prevent settling. The operational details include continuous monitoring of pH and flow rate, with adjustments made to the aeration and mixing intensity based on these parameters. The tank is periodically desludged to remove accumulated solids. The residence time in the equalization tank is maintained at approximately 18 hours to ensure adequate homogenization and buffering.
    *   **Efficiency**: The equalization tank is not designed for pollutant removal per se, but rather for stabilizing the wastewater characteristics. It can provide a reduction in suspended solids through settling. The efficiency of the equalization tank in buffering flow and concentration variations is crucial for the subsequent treatment processes. Effective equalization can improve the overall efficiency of the ETP by 10-20%.

2.  **Neutralization / pH Adjustment**:

    *   **Principle**: The pH of industrial wastewater can vary widely depending on the processes involved. Most biological treatment processes are sensitive to pH, with optimal performance typically occurring in a neutral to slightly alkaline range (pH 6.5 - 8.5). Neutralization involves adjusting the pH of the wastewater to this optimal range. Acidic wastewater is treated with alkaline chemicals (e.g., lime, sodium hydroxide), while alkaline wastewater is treated with acidic chemicals (e.g., sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid). The principle relies on acid-base reactions to bring the pH to the desired level.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the neutralization system depends on the wastewater's pH range and buffering capacity. Key design parameters include the chemical feed rate, mixing intensity, and reaction time. The chemical feed rate is determined based on the stoichiometric requirements for neutralizing the wastewater. The mixing intensity should be sufficient to ensure rapid and uniform distribution of the chemical. A reaction time of 15-30 minutes is typically provided to allow the neutralization reaction to reach completion. Automatic pH control systems, using pH sensors and feedback loops, are often used to maintain the desired pH level.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the wastewater pH is continuously monitored using online pH sensors. Based on the pH reading, a chemical dosing system automatically adds either an acid or an alkali solution to adjust the pH. The chemical is added to a rapid mixing tank, where it is thoroughly mixed with the wastewater. The mixing is achieved using high-speed mixers. The pH adjustment process is carefully controlled to prevent over- or under-dosing, which can affect the performance of downstream treatment units. The target pH range is maintained between 7.0 and 7.5.
    *   **Efficiency**: The efficiency of the neutralization process is measured by its ability to maintain the pH within the desired range. A well-designed and operated neutralization system can achieve a pH within ±0.2 units of the target pH. This precise control is crucial for optimizing the performance of subsequent biological treatment processes. Effective pH control can improve the overall efficiency of the biological treatment by 15-25%.

3.  **Primary Treatment (Coagulation-Flocculation-Sedimentation)**:

    *   **Principle**: Primary treatment focuses on removing suspended solids and colloidal particles from the wastewater. This is achieved through a combination of coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation. Coagulation involves adding chemical coagulants (e.g., alum, ferric chloride) to the wastewater. These coagulants neutralize the surface charges of the colloidal particles, allowing them to destabilize and aggregate. Flocculation is the process of gently mixing the wastewater to promote the formation of larger, settleable flocs. Sedimentation involves allowing the flocs to settle under gravity in a sedimentation tank. The settled solids (sludge) are then removed from the bottom of the tank.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the primary treatment system is based on several key parameters. The coagulant dosage is determined through jar tests, which simulate the coagulation-flocculation process in the laboratory. The mixing intensity in the flocculation tank is critical for promoting floc formation without breaking the flocs. Typical flocculation times range from 20 to 40 minutes, with gentle mixing provided by paddle mixers or similar devices. The sedimentation tank is designed to provide sufficient settling time for the flocs to settle. Typical surface loading rates for sedimentation tanks range from 20 to 40 m3/m2/day. The tank volume is calculated based on the flow rate and the desired retention time, usually around 2-4 hours.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, alum is used as the coagulant. The alum is added to the wastewater in a rapid mixing tank, where it is quickly dispersed. The wastewater then flows to the flocculation tank, where it is gently mixed using paddle mixers. The flocculated wastewater then enters the sedimentation tank, where the flocs are allowed to settle. The settled sludge is periodically removed from the bottom of the tank using a sludge scraper mechanism. The sludge is then dewatered and disposed of properly. The overflow from the sedimentation tank, which is now clarified, flows to the secondary treatment stage.
    *   **Efficiency**: The primary treatment process can effectively remove a significant portion of the suspended solids and associated pollutants. Typical removal efficiencies for suspended solids range from 50% to 70%, and for BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand), the removal efficiency can be 20-30%. The efficiency depends on the coagulant dosage, mixing intensity, and settling time. Effective primary treatment reduces the load on the subsequent biological treatment process, improving its overall efficiency.

4.  **Secondary (Biological) Treatment (Activated Sludge Process - ASP)**:

    *   **Principle**: Secondary treatment utilizes biological processes to remove dissolved organic pollutants from the wastewater. The Activated Sludge Process (ASP) is a widely used biological treatment method. In ASP, microorganisms (bacteria, protozoa, and fungi) are used to oxidize organic matter in the wastewater. The microorganisms are grown in a suspension, forming a "sludge" of biological solids. The wastewater is mixed with the activated sludge in an aeration tank, where air or oxygen is supplied to support the microbial activity. The microorganisms consume the organic pollutants as food, converting them into carbon dioxide, water, and more microbial biomass. The mixture of wastewater and activated sludge is then sent to a clarifier, where the sludge settles out, separating the treated water from the biomass. A portion of the settled sludge is recycled back to the aeration tank to maintain a high concentration of microorganisms, while the excess sludge is removed as waste activated sludge (WAS).
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the ASP system is based on several key parameters. The organic loading rate (measured as BOD or COD per unit volume per unit time) is a critical parameter that determines the size of the aeration tank. The solids retention time (SRT) or mean cell residence time (MCRT) is another important parameter, which controls the age and activity of the microorganisms. Typical SRT values range from 5 to 15 days. The mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration, which is the concentration of biological solids in the aeration tank, is typically maintained in the range of 2000 to 4000 mg/L. The dissolved oxygen (DO) level in the aeration tank must be maintained above 2 mg/L to ensure adequate microbial activity.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the ASP system consists of an aeration tank and a secondary clarifier. The aeration tank is equipped with diffused air aeration to provide oxygen to the microorganisms. The MLSS concentration is monitored regularly, and adjustments are made to the sludge recycle rate and the WAS wasting rate to maintain the desired MLSS level. The DO level is continuously monitored and controlled. The wastewater is mixed with the activated sludge in the aeration tank for a retention time of approximately 6-8 hours. The mixture then flows to the secondary clarifier, where the sludge settles out. The clarified effluent flows to the tertiary treatment stage, while the settled sludge is recycled back to the aeration tank.
    *   **Efficiency**: The ASP system is highly effective in removing BOD and COD from the wastewater. Typical removal efficiencies for BOD range from 85% to 95%, and for COD, the removal efficiency can be 75-85%. The efficiency depends on the organic loading rate, SRT, MLSS concentration, and DO level. Effective operation of the ASP system is crucial for meeting the discharge standards and protecting the environment.

5.  **Tertiary Treatment (Filtration: Sand/Carbon, UF/RO)**:

    *   **Principle**: Tertiary treatment is implemented to further polish the effluent from the secondary treatment stage, removing any remaining suspended solids, turbidity, and dissolved pollutants. At this facility, the tertiary treatment consists of a combination of filtration (sand and carbon) followed by Ultrafiltration (UF) or Reverse Osmosis (RO). Sand filtration removes fine suspended solids that may have carried over from the secondary clarifier. Activated carbon filtration removes dissolved organic compounds and color, improving the clarity and odor of the effluent. UF and RO are membrane filtration processes that remove dissolved salts, organic molecules, and microorganisms. UF removes larger molecules, while RO removes even smaller ions and molecules, producing a high-quality effluent.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the tertiary treatment system is based on the desired effluent quality and the characteristics of the secondary effluent. The filtration rate for sand filters typically ranges from 5 to 10 m/h. The empty bed contact time (EBCT) for activated carbon filters is typically 10-20 minutes. The operating pressure for UF membranes typically ranges from 2 to 7 bar, while the operating pressure for RO membranes can range from 15 to 60 bar, depending on the desired salt rejection. The membrane flux (flow rate per unit membrane area) is an important parameter that affects the membrane performance and lifespan.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the effluent from the secondary clarifier first passes through a sand filter to remove any remaining suspended solids. The sand filter is backwashed periodically to remove accumulated solids. The filtered water then flows through an activated carbon filter to remove dissolved organic compounds. The activated carbon is replaced periodically when its adsorption capacity is exhausted. The effluent from the carbon filter then passes through either a UF or RO system, depending on the desired effluent quality. The UF/RO system removes dissolved salts and other contaminants. The permeate (treated water) is collected and stored for reuse, while the concentrate (reject water) is either recycled back to the ETP or disposed of properly.
    *   **Efficiency**: The tertiary treatment system is highly effective in improving the effluent quality. Sand filtration can remove up to 90% of the remaining suspended solids. Activated carbon filtration can remove up to 80% of the dissolved organic compounds. UF can remove virtually all suspended solids and microorganisms, while RO can remove up to 99% of the dissolved salts. The overall efficiency of the tertiary treatment system depends on the specific technologies used and the operating conditions.

6.  **Disinfection**:

    *   **Principle**: Disinfection is the final step in the wastewater treatment process and is aimed at inactivating any remaining pathogenic microorganisms in the treated effluent. Common disinfection methods include UV irradiation and chlorination. UV irradiation uses ultraviolet light to damage the DNA of microorganisms, preventing them from reproducing. Chlorination involves adding chlorine to the wastewater, which kills or inactivates the microorganisms.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the disinfection system is based on the desired level of disinfection and the characteristics of the effluent. The UV dose (UV intensity multiplied by exposure time) is a critical parameter for UV disinfection. The chlorine dosage and contact time are important parameters for chlorination. The chlorine residual (the concentration of chlorine remaining in the effluent after a certain contact time) must be carefully controlled to ensure effective disinfection without creating harmful disinfection byproducts.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the effluent from the tertiary treatment stage is disinfected using UV irradiation. The UV system consists of a series of UV lamps that are submerged in the effluent. The UV lamps emit UV light that inactivates the microorganisms. The UV dose is monitored and controlled to ensure effective disinfection. The UV lamps are replaced periodically when their intensity decreases.
    *   **Efficiency**: Disinfection is highly effective in inactivating pathogenic microorganisms. UV disinfection can achieve a 4-log reduction (99.99% inactivation) of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Chlorination can also achieve a high level of disinfection, but it may produce harmful disinfection byproducts if not properly controlled. The efficiency of disinfection depends on the method used, the dosage, and the characteristics of the effluent.

### 7.8 Description of Sewage Treatment Plant (STP)

The Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) at this facility is designed to treat domestic sewage generated from restrooms, canteens, and other sanitary facilities. The STP utilizes a multi-stage treatment process, combining physical, and biological methods to ensure the treated effluent meets the required discharge standards and is suitable for reuse for gardening. The plant has a capacity of 20 KLD. The detailed description of each stage is provided below:

1.  **Collection & Equalization**:

    *   **Principle**: The initial stage involves collecting the domestic sewage from various sources within the facility. The collected sewage is then directed to an equalization tank. The primary principle of the equalization tank is to dampen flow rate and pollutant concentration fluctuations, providing a consistent feed to the downstream treatment units. This reduces shock loading and improves the stability and efficiency of biological treatment. The equalization tank also allows for the settling of some heavier solids.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the equalization tank is critical. Typical design parameters include a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8-12 hours to effectively buffer variations in flow and pollutant load. The tank volume is calculated based on the anticipated peak flow rate and the required HRT. Aeration is often provided to prevent the settling of solids and the development of anaerobic conditions, which can lead to odor issues. The mixing intensity should be sufficient to maintain solids in suspension but not so high as to disrupt settling.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the sewage is collected from different units through a network of pipelines and channels. The equalization tank is equipped with aerators and mixers to maintain a homogeneous mixture and prevent settling. The operational details include continuous monitoring of pH and flow rate, with adjustments made to the aeration and mixing intensity based on these parameters. The tank is periodically desludged to remove accumulated solids. The residence time in the equalization tank is maintained to ensure adequate homogenization and buffering.
    *   **Efficiency**: The equalization tank is not designed for pollutant removal per se, but rather for stabilizing the sewage characteristics. It can provide a reduction in suspended solids through settling. The efficiency of the equalization tank in buffering flow and concentration variations is crucial for the subsequent treatment processes.

2.  **Screen Chamber**:

    *   **Principle**: A screen chamber is the first physical treatment process in the STP. Its primary purpose is to remove large solids and debris from the raw sewage. These materials can include rags, paper, plastics, and other non-biodegradable items. The principle behind screening is simple: sewage flows through a screen, which traps the large solids while allowing the liquid to pass through. This protects downstream equipment from clogging or damage, reduces the load on subsequent treatment processes, and improves the overall efficiency of the STP.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the screen chamber depends on the flow rate of the sewage and the size of the solids to be removed. There are two main types of screens: coarse screens and fine screens. Coarse screens typically have openings of 6 mm or larger, while fine screens have openings of 1.5 to 6 mm. The choice of screen size depends on the specific requirements of the STP. The screen chamber should be designed to handle peak flow rates without overflowing. The screen should be easily accessible for cleaning and maintenance.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, a coarse screen is used to remove large solids from the raw sewage. The screen is cleaned manually on a regular basis to prevent clogging. The collected solids are disposed of properly. The frequency of cleaning depends on the amount of solids in the sewage.
    *   **Efficiency**: The screen chamber can effectively remove a significant portion of the large solids from the sewage. The removal efficiency depends on the screen size and the amount of solids in the sewage. Effective screening reduces the load on the subsequent treatment processes and improves the overall efficiency of the STP.

3.  **Oil & Grease Trap**:

    *   **Principle**: An oil and grease trap is designed to remove free-floating oil and grease from the sewage. Oil and grease can interfere with the biological treatment processes and cause problems with the sludge handling. The principle behind the oil and grease trap is that oil and grease are less dense than water and will float to the surface. The trap is designed to provide a quiescent zone where the oil and grease can separate from the water and be retained.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the oil and grease trap depends on the flow rate of the sewage and the concentration of oil and grease. The trap should be sized to provide sufficient retention time for the oil and grease to separate. The trap should be easily accessible for cleaning and maintenance.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, an oil and grease trap is installed after the screen chamber. The trap is cleaned manually on a regular basis to remove the accumulated oil and grease. The collected oil and grease are disposed of properly.
    *   **Efficiency**: The oil and grease trap can effectively remove a significant portion of the free-floating oil and grease from the sewage. The removal efficiency depends on the design of the trap and the concentration of oil and grease in the sewage. Effective removal of oil and grease prevents interference with the biological treatment processes and improves the overall efficiency of the STP.

4.  **Anaerobic/Settling Tank**:

    *   **Principle**: An anaerobic/settling tank is an optional pre-treatment step in the STP. It combines the functions of anaerobic digestion and settling. In the anaerobic zone, microorganisms break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, converting it into biogas (methane and carbon dioxide) and other byproducts. Simultaneously, the tank allows for the settling of solids under gravity. The settled sludge undergoes anaerobic digestion, further reducing the volume of sludge. The clarified effluent flows to the next treatment stage.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the anaerobic/settling tank depends on the flow rate of the sewage and the organic load. The tank should be sized to provide sufficient retention time for both anaerobic digestion and settling. The tank should be designed to prevent the escape of biogas.
    *   **Operational Details**: Data Not Available. There is no information available whether or not the plant includes an Anaerobic/Settling Tank.
    *   **Efficiency**: Data Not Available. There is no information available whether or not the plant includes an Anaerobic/Settling Tank.

5.  **Biological Treatment (MBBR)**:

    *   **Principle**: The Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) is a biological treatment process that uses microorganisms attached to small plastic carriers to remove organic pollutants from the sewage. The carriers are suspended in the aeration tank, providing a large surface area for the microorganisms to grow. The sewage is mixed with the carriers, and air or oxygen is supplied to support the microbial activity. The microorganisms consume the organic pollutants as food, converting them into carbon dioxide, water, and more microbial biomass. The MBBR process is highly effective in removing BOD and COD from the sewage.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the MBBR system is based on several key parameters. The carrier fill ratio (the percentage of the tank volume occupied by the carriers) is a critical parameter that affects the performance of the system. Typical carrier fill ratios range from 20% to 70%. The specific surface area of the carriers (the surface area per unit volume of carrier) is another important parameter. The aeration rate is also a critical parameter.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the MBBR system consists of an aeration tank filled with plastic carriers. The sewage is mixed with the carriers, and air is supplied using diffused air aerators. The carriers are kept in suspension by the aeration. The treated sewage then flows to the secondary clarifier.
    *   **Efficiency**: The MBBR system is highly effective in removing BOD and COD from the sewage. Typical removal efficiencies for BOD range from 80% to 95%, and for COD, the removal efficiency can be 70-85%.

6.  **Secondary Clarifier**:

    *   **Principle**: The secondary clarifier is designed to separate the biological solids (biomass) from the treated sewage after the biological treatment process (MBBR in this case). The principle behind the clarifier is that the biological solids are denser than water and will settle to the bottom of the tank under gravity. The clarifier provides a quiescent zone where the solids can settle, while the clarified effluent flows over a weir at the top of the tank. The settled sludge is then removed from the bottom of the tank.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the secondary clarifier depends on the flow rate of the sewage and the settling characteristics of the biological solids. Typical surface loading rates for secondary clarifiers range from 15 to 30 m3/m2/day. The tank volume is calculated based on the flow rate and the desired retention time.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the sewage from the MBBR system flows to the secondary clarifier. The sludge settles to the bottom of the tank and is periodically removed using a sludge scraper mechanism. A portion of the sludge is recycled back to the MBBR tank to maintain a high concentration of microorganisms, while the excess sludge is removed as waste activated sludge (WAS). The clarified effluent flows to the tertiary treatment stage.
    *   **Efficiency**: The secondary clarifier is highly effective in separating the biological solids from the treated sewage. The removal efficiency for suspended solids typically ranges from 80% to 95%.

7.  **Tertiary Treatment (PSF, ACF, Disinfection)**:

    *   **Principle**: Tertiary treatment is implemented to further polish the effluent from the secondary treatment stage, removing any remaining suspended solids, turbidity, and dissolved pollutants. At this facility, the tertiary treatment consists of a combination of Pressure Sand Filtration (PSF) followed by Activated Carbon Filtration (ACF) and Disinfection. Sand filtration removes fine suspended solids that may have carried over from the secondary clarifier. Activated carbon filtration removes dissolved organic compounds and color, improving the clarity and odor of the effluent. Disinfection inactivates any remaining pathogenic microorganisms in the treated effluent.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the tertiary treatment system is based on the desired effluent quality and the characteristics of the secondary effluent. The filtration rate for sand filters typically ranges from 5 to 10 m/h. The empty bed contact time (EBCT) for activated carbon filters is typically 10-20 minutes. The dosage for disinfection depends on the method used and the desired level of disinfection.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the effluent from the secondary clarifier first passes through a pressure sand filter to remove any remaining suspended solids. The sand filter is backwashed periodically to remove accumulated solids. The filtered water then flows through an activated carbon filter to remove dissolved organic compounds. The activated carbon is replaced periodically when its adsorption capacity is exhausted. Finally, the effluent is disinfected to inactivate any remaining pathogenic microorganisms.
    *   **Efficiency**: The tertiary treatment system is highly effective in improving the effluent quality. Sand filtration can remove up to 90% of the remaining suspended solids. Activated carbon filtration can remove up to 80% of the dissolved organic compounds. Disinfection can achieve a high level of inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms.

8.  **Treated Water Storage**:

    *   **Principle**: After tertiary treatment and disinfection, the treated water is stored in a treated water storage tank. This tank provides a buffer between the treatment process and the end use (gardening in this case). The storage tank ensures that there is always a supply of treated water available for gardening, even when the STP is not operating at full capacity.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the treated water storage tank depends on the demand for treated water for gardening. The tank should be sized to provide sufficient storage capacity to meet the peak demand. The tank should be designed to prevent contamination of the treated water.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the treated water storage tank is sized to provide sufficient storage capacity for the gardening needs. The tank is periodically inspected and cleaned to prevent contamination. The treated water is pumped from the storage tank to the gardening area.
    *   **Efficiency**: The treated water storage tank ensures that there is always a supply of treated water available for gardening.

9.  **Sludge Handling**:

    *   **Principle**: Sludge is a byproduct of the wastewater treatment process. It consists of settled solids and biological biomass. Sludge handling involves the treatment and disposal of the sludge in an environmentally sound manner. Common sludge handling processes include thickening, dewatering, and disposal. Thickening reduces the volume of the sludge, while dewatering removes water from the sludge. The dewatered sludge can then be disposed of in a landfill or used as a soil amendment.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the sludge handling system depends on the amount and characteristics of the sludge. The thickening and dewatering processes should be designed to reduce the volume and water content of the sludge to a manageable level. The disposal method should be environmentally sound and comply with all applicable regulations.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the sludge from the secondary clarifier is thickened and dewatered. The dewatered sludge is then disposed of in a landfill.
    *   **Efficiency**: Effective sludge handling reduces the volume and water content of the sludge, making it easier to dispose of in an environmentally sound manner.

### 8.2 Water Sources and Consumption

#### A. Water Sources

**Primary Sources:** Abaris Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. primarily relies on groundwater to meet its water demands. The groundwater is extracted through two borewells, identified as BW-1 and BW-2.

### 9.2.1 Detailed Feasibility Analysis for EACH Measure

The following sections provide a detailed feasibility analysis for each water conservation measure listed in the table. Each analysis covers the technical feasibility, economic analysis, and environmental impact assessment.

#### 9.2.1.1 Reject Water Recovery from RO Plant (Industrial Process - WFI)

**Technical Feasibility:**

Implementing a reject water recovery system from the Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant involves several key steps. The RO reject water, which typically contains higher concentrations of dissolved solids, needs to be pre-treated to remove any remaining impurities that could foul the RO membranes if recycled directly.

*   **Pre-treatment System:** This usually involves a combination of processes such as:
    *   **Multimedia Filtration:** To remove suspended solids and turbidity. Typical specifications would include a flow rate capable of handling the RO reject flow (approx. 5 KLD), a bed depth of at least 1 meter, and filter media with varying particle sizes (e.g., anthracite, sand, gravel).
    *   **Activated Carbon Filtration:** To remove chlorine, organic matter, and other compounds that could damage the RO membranes. A granular activated carbon (GAC) filter is typically used, with a contact time of at least 10 minutes and regular backwashing.
    *   **Antiscalant Dosing:** To prevent scaling on the RO membranes due to the higher concentration of dissolved solids. A suitable antiscalant chemical is selected based on the water chemistry of the RO reject water, and a dosing pump is used to inject the chemical at the appropriate concentration.
*   **RO System:** The pre-treated RO reject water is then fed into a smaller RO system designed to handle the specific characteristics of the reject water. This system will typically operate at a higher pressure than the primary RO system due to the increased osmotic pressure of the reject water. The membrane type (e.g., thin-film composite) and membrane area are selected based on the desired permeate quality and recovery rate.
*   **Piping and Pumps:** New piping will be required to transport the RO reject water to the pre-treatment system and then to the secondary RO system. Centrifugal pumps with appropriate flow rates and head pressures will be needed to overcome the pressure losses in the system. All piping materials should be compatible with the water chemistry to prevent corrosion and contamination. Stainless steel (SS316) is a common choice.
*   **Automation and Control:** A programmable logic controller (PLC) can be used to automate the operation of the RO reject recovery system. The PLC can monitor flow rates, pressures, and water quality parameters, and automatically adjust the system settings to optimize performance. Sensors for conductivity, pH, and turbidity can be integrated into the system to provide real-time monitoring of the water quality. Automated backwashing of the filters and cleaning of the RO membranes can also be programmed into the PLC.

The recovered permeate can then be blended with the permeate from the primary RO system and used for WFI production. This requires careful monitoring of the water quality to ensure that it meets the stringent requirements for WFI. Online TOC analyzers and conductivity meters can be used to continuously monitor the water quality.

**Economic Analysis:**

The economic feasibility of this measure depends on the capital cost of the equipment, the operating costs (including electricity, chemicals, and maintenance), and the value of the water saved.

*   **Capital Cost:** The capital cost of the RO reject recovery system can be estimated based on the following components:
    *   Pre-treatment system: ₹ 5,00,000 (Including multimedia filter, activated carbon filter, and antiscalant dosing system)
    *   Secondary RO system: ₹ 10,00,000 (Including RO membranes, pressure vessels, and pumps)
    *   Piping and pumps: ₹ 2,00,000
    *   Automation and control: ₹ 3,00,000
    *   Installation and commissioning: ₹ 2,00,000
    *   **Total Capital Cost: ₹ 22,00,000**
*   **Operating Costs:** The operating costs include:
    *   Electricity: Assuming the system operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and consumes 5 kW of power, the annual electricity consumption is 43,800 kWh. At a cost of ₹ 8 per kWh, the annual electricity cost is ₹ 3,50,400.
    *   Chemicals: The cost of antiscalant and cleaning chemicals can be estimated at ₹ 50,000 per year.
    *   Maintenance: The cost of membrane replacement and other maintenance can be estimated at ₹ 1,00,000 per year.
    *   **Total Operating Costs: ₹ 5,00,400 per year**
*   **Savings:** The savings from water conservation is 1825 kL/year. Assuming the cost of water is ₹ 50 per kL, the annual savings is ₹ 91,250.
*   **Return on Investment (ROI) Calculation:**
    *   Annual Savings = ₹ 91,250
    *   Annual Operating Costs = ₹ 5,00,400
    *   Net Annual Cost = ₹ 4,09,150
    *   Payback Period = Capital Cost / Net Annual Cost = ₹ 22,00,000 / ₹-4,09,150= -5.37 Years.

**Formula Used:**
    *   ROI = (Annual Savings - Annual Operating Costs) / Capital Cost
    *   Payback Period = Capital Cost / (Annual Savings - Annual Operating Costs)

The payback period of over 5 years suggests the recovery system may not be financially viable without higher water tariffs, government rebates, or grants. Further detailed cost analysis is needed to prove the feasibility.

**Environmental Impact:**

Recovering RO reject water reduces the demand for freshwater, conserving valuable resources. It also decreases the volume of wastewater discharged, reducing the load on the wastewater treatment plant and the potential for pollution. The energy consumption of the RO reject recovery system should be considered, but the overall environmental impact is generally positive due to the reduced water consumption.

A full lifecycle assessment should be performed to quantify the environmental benefits, including the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions associated with water extraction and treatment, the decrease in water pollution, and the conservation of aquatic ecosystems.

#### 9.2.1.2 Condensate Recovery System (Utility - Boiler)

**Technical Feasibility:**

Implementing a condensate recovery system involves collecting the hot condensate from steam-using equipment and returning it to the boiler feedwater tank. This reduces the demand for makeup water and saves energy because the condensate is already hot and treated.

*   **Condensate Collection:** This requires installing piping to collect the condensate from steam traps and other equipment. The piping should be properly insulated to minimize heat loss and corrosion-resistant to withstand the hot condensate. Stainless steel (SS304 or SS316) is a common choice for condensate piping.
*   **Condensate Return Pump:** A condensate return pump is needed to pump the condensate back to the boiler feedwater tank. The pump should be sized to handle the flow rate of the condensate and have sufficient head pressure to overcome the pressure losses in the piping.
*   **Condensate Receiver Tank:** A condensate receiver tank is used to collect the condensate before it is pumped back to the boiler. The tank should be sized to provide adequate storage capacity and should be equipped with a vent to release non-condensable gases.
*   **Water Treatment:** The recovered condensate may need to be treated to remove any contaminants that could damage the boiler. This may involve filtration, deaeration, or chemical treatment. A dissolved oxygen analyzer can be used to monitor the oxygen level in the condensate and adjust the deaeration process accordingly.
*   **Piping and Insulation:** Installing insulated piping and proper traps

**Economic Analysis:**

*   **Capital Cost:** The capital cost of the condensate recovery system can be estimated as follows:
    *   Piping and insulation: ₹ 3,00,000
    *   Condensate return pump: ₹ 1,00,000
    *   Condensate receiver tank: ₹ 50,000
    *   Water treatment equipment: ₹ 50,000
    *   Installation and commissioning: ₹ 1,00,000
    *   **Total Capital Cost: ₹ 6,00,000**
*   **Operating Costs:** The operating costs include:
    *   Electricity: Assuming the condensate return pump consumes 2 kW of power and operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, the annual electricity consumption is 17,520 kWh. At a cost of ₹ 8 per kWh, the annual electricity cost is ₹ 1,40,160.
    *   Chemicals: The cost of chemicals for condensate treatment can be estimated at ₹ 20,000 per year.
    *   Maintenance: The cost of pump maintenance and other repairs can be estimated at ₹ 30,000 per year.
    *   **Total Operating Costs: ₹ 1,90,160 per year**
*   **Savings:** The savings from water conservation is 730 kL/year. Assuming the cost of water is ₹ 50 per kL, the annual savings is ₹ 36,500.
    In addition to water savings, there will be significant savings in fuel consumption due to the reduced demand for boiler heat. The savings can be calculated as follows:
    Heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water from ambient temperature (e.g., 30°C) to boiling point (100°C) = 70 kcal
    Heat required to convert 1 kg of water to steam at 100°C (latent heat of vaporization) = 540 kcal
    Total heat required to generate 1 kg of steam = 610 kcal.
    Heat content of condensate, returning to the boiler at 80°C= 80 kcal/kg
    If we assume a boiler efficiency of 80%, saving 530 kcal/kg translate to 662.5 kcal/kg fuel required by avoiding heating the make-up water.

    Heating Value of fuel oil = 10,000 kcal/kg
    Fuel Consumption saved (kL/year)= 730 kL/year *1000 kg/ kL * 530 kcal/kg of steam/ 10,000 kcal/ kg of fuel oil=38690 kg/year
    Fuel Cost savings= 38690 kg/year * ₹60/kg=₹2321400/year
    Total savings = Water Saving + Fuel Saving = ₹ 36,500 + ₹ 23,21,400 = ₹ 23,57,900
*   **Return on Investment (ROI) Calculation:**
    *   Annual Savings = ₹ 23,57,900
    *   Annual Operating Costs = ₹ 1,90,160
    *   Net Annual Savings = ₹ 21,67,740
    *   Payback Period = Capital Cost / Net Annual Savings = ₹ 6,00,000 / ₹ 21,67,740= 0.28 Years or 3.3 Months

**Formula Used:**
    *   ROI = (Annual Savings - Annual Operating Costs) / Capital Cost
    *   Payback Period = Capital Cost / (Annual Savings - Annual Operating Costs)

This has a fast return and warrants a good implementation

**Environmental Impact:**

By reusing condensate, the demand for make-up water decreases and so does the energy demand. It is very environmentally friendly.

#### 9.2.1.3 Install Aerators in Taps (Domestic Water Use)
