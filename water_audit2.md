### 4.2.1 Detailed Process Description

*   **Water Generation**:
    The water generation stage involves multiple steps to produce Water for Injection (WFI), which is a critical ingredient for pharmaceutical products, especially injectables and IV fluids. The raw water is first pre-treated to remove suspended solids, chlorine, and other impurities. The pre-treated water then passes through a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system, which uses pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane, removing dissolved salts, minerals, and organic contaminants. The RO permeate is further purified using Electrodeionization (EDI), a continuous, chemical-free process that removes ionized and ionizable species from the water. Finally, the EDI effluent is fed into a WFI still, which uses distillation to produce high-purity WFI. The principle of operation for the RO system relies on pressure differential across the membrane, EDI uses electrical potential to separate ions, and the WFI still uses heat to evaporate and condense water, leaving behind impurities. Water usage in this stage is significant, and the quality must meet stringent pharmacopeial standards. Wastage occurs during the RO and EDI processes as reject water. Critical process parameters include RO feed pressure, EDI voltage, and still temperature, all of which must be carefully monitored to ensure water quality and minimize wastage. Regular maintenance and membrane cleaning are crucial for RO performance. A Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analyzer is used to ensure water quality. Water for Injection (WFI) is the critical raw material and any inefficiency or wastage will have significant impact. WFI is stored in validated storage tanks, under nitrogen blanketing, to maintain its purity.

*   **Formulation**:
    The formulation stage involves mixing WFI with active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and excipients according to validated formulations. This process is typically carried out in stainless steel (SS316L) mixing tanks equipped with agitators to ensure homogenous mixing. The mixing tanks are designed to maintain precise temperature control and are often jacketed to allow for heating or cooling. The principle of operation for the mixing tanks involves mechanical agitation to create a uniform solution. Water usage in this stage is primarily for cleaning and rinsing the tanks and equipment after each batch. The quality of the water used for cleaning must meet purified water standards. Critical process parameters include mixing speed, temperature, and mixing time, which must be carefully controlled to ensure the homogeneity and stability of the formulation. The tanks are also equipped with CIP (Clean-In-Place) systems to minimise water usage during cleaning.

*   **Filling**:
    The filling stage involves dispensing the formulated product into the final containers, such as plastic bags for IV fluids or vials for injectables. In this case, IV fluids are filled using Form-Fill-Seal (FFS) technology, a process in which a plastic film is formed into a container, filled with the product, and then sealed, all in a continuous operation. The FFS machine uses heat and pressure to form the container and seal it after filling. Water usage in this stage is minimal, primarily for cleaning and sterilization of the filling equipment. The quality of the water used for cleaning must meet purified water standards, and sterile WFI is used for rinsing parts that come into direct contact with the product. Critical process parameters include filling volume, sealing temperature, and machine speed, which must be carefully controlled to ensure accurate filling and prevent leaks. The FFS machine operates in a cleanroom environment and is regularly sanitised using sanitising agents.

*   **Sterilization**:
    The sterilization stage is crucial for ensuring the sterility of the final product. The filled and sealed containers are subjected to sterilization using an autoclave, which uses high-pressure steam to kill microorganisms. The autoclave operates on the principle of saturated steam under pressure, which denatures microbial proteins and renders them inactive. Water usage in this stage is primarily for generating steam in the autoclave. The quality of the water used for steam generation must meet boiler feedwater standards to prevent scaling and corrosion. Critical process parameters include sterilization temperature, pressure, and cycle time, which must be carefully controlled to ensure effective sterilization. Autoclaves are equipped with temperature and pressure sensors and are regularly validated to ensure proper operation.

*   **Packaging**:
    The packaging stage involves inspecting the sterilized products for defects and then packaging them into cartons or boxes for distribution. This stage typically involves manual or automated inspection, labeling, and packing operations. Water usage in this stage is minimal, primarily for cleaning the packaging area. Critical process parameters include packaging integrity and proper labeling.

### 4.5 Details of Available Advanced Water Efficient Technologies

Several advanced water-efficient technologies are relevant to the pharmaceutical industry, particularly for sterile manufacturing:

*   **Advanced Membrane Filtration**: Technologies such as nanofiltration (NF) and ultrafiltration (UF) can be used for pretreatment of raw water or for recovery of valuable components from process streams. These technologies operate at lower pressures than RO, reducing energy consumption and potentially decreasing water wastage.
*   **Vacuum Distillation**: Vacuum distillation can reduce the energy required for WFI generation compared to conventional distillation methods. By lowering the boiling point of water, less heat is needed to achieve evaporation.
*   **Closed-loop Cooling Systems**: Implementing closed-loop cooling systems for chillers and other equipment can significantly reduce water consumption. These systems recirculate cooling water, minimizing evaporative losses and reducing the need for makeup water. Dry coolers can also be utilized for further water reduction.
*   **Membrane Bioreactors (MBR)**: MBR technology combines biological treatment with membrane filtration for wastewater treatment. MBR can produce high-quality effluent suitable for reuse in non-critical applications, reducing the overall water demand.
*   **Forward Osmosis (FO)**: FO can be used to concentrate wastewater streams, reducing the volume of effluent that needs to be treated and disposed of. FO can also be used for desalination.
*   **Smart Water Management Systems**: Implementing smart water management systems can help track water usage, identify leaks, and optimize water consumption across the facility. These systems use sensors, data analytics, and automation to improve water efficiency.

### 4.6 Assessment of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD)

The plant operates on a partial ZLD basis. Process effluent is treated and recycled. Domestic sewage is treated and used for gardening. This is a positive step towards environmental sustainability and water conservation. A full assessment would require detailed data on the treatment processes, volumes of water recycled, and the quality of the recycled water. Further investigation is needed to determine the extent to which ZLD is implemented and its effectiveness. A detailed study of the effluent treatment plant (ETP) would be required, to assess its performance and water recovery rate.

### 6.3 Gap Analysis and Recommendations

**WFI Generation:**

*   **Gap:** The industry uses double pass RO and Multi-column distillation. The BAT suggests using a Cold WFI System (Membrane-Based) incorporating RO, EDI, ultrafiltration, and UV sterilization.
*   **Technical Comparison:** Multi-column distillation is energy-intensive compared to membrane-based systems. Cold WFI systems offer lower operating costs due to reduced energy consumption and potentially lower maintenance requirements. Membrane-based systems also provide consistent water quality and reduce the risk of pyrogen contamination due to cold operation.
*   **Recommendation:** Evaluate the feasibility of replacing the existing multi-column distillation system with a cold WFI system. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis, considering capital expenditure, operating costs (including energy consumption), and water quality improvements. Monitor the performance of the existing system and compare it with the potential performance of a cold WFI system to quantify the potential savings and benefits.

**Filling Line:**

*   **Gap:** The industry utilizes Automatic FFS machines. While this is a good practice, there is no mention of using Isolator and Restricted Access Barrier Systems (RABS).
*   **Technical Comparison:** Isolator and RABS provide a superior level of aseptic control compared to conventional cleanroom environments. They minimize human intervention, reducing the risk of contamination during the filling process.
*   **Recommendation:** Assess the risk associated with the current filling process and evaluate the potential benefits of implementing Isolator and RABS technology. This may involve upgrading existing filling lines or incorporating Isolator/RABS in new installations.

**Utilities:**

*   **Gap:** Data Not Available. There is no information provided about the type of cooling towers, blowdown controls, boilers, or heat recovery systems in use.
*   **Recommendation:** Conduct a detailed audit of the utility systems, including cooling towers, boilers, and compressed air systems. Assess the performance of these systems and compare them with BATs such as Hybrid/Adiabatic Cooling Towers, High-Efficiency Drift Eliminators, Automated Blowdown & Water Quality Controls, High-Efficiency Packaged Boilers, Boiler Blowdown Heat Recovery Systems, and Oxygen/Combustion Control with Flue Gas Analyzer. Implement measures to improve the efficiency of these systems and reduce water consumption.

**ETP/STP:**

*   **Gap:** Based on the technologies used, the current ETP and STP are adequate. However, the degree of recycling and reuse is unknown.
*   **Technical Comparison:** While the plant uses adequate ETP and STP, optimizing water reuse within the facility will reduce freshwater intake.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement a comprehensive water reuse program to maximize the use of treated effluent from the ETP and STP. Identify potential applications for treated water, such as cooling tower makeup, irrigation, or equipment washing. Ensure that the treated water meets the required quality standards for each application. Install monitoring systems to track the performance of the ETP and STP and the quality of the treated water.

### 7. WASTEWATER TREATMENT & DISPOSAL

### 7.1 Waste water collection, treatment details
The facility generates wastewater from industrial processes, domestic use, and cooling/boiler operations. This wastewater is segregated and treated through two separate treatment systems: an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) for industrial wastewater and a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) for domestic wastewater. The treated water is then recycled for uses such as gardening/green belt maintenance and floor washing. The ETP has a capacity of 100 KLD and utilizes a combination of primary, secondary (ASP - Activated Sludge Process), and tertiary (RO/UF - Reverse Osmosis/Ultrafiltration) treatment technologies. The STP has a capacity of 20 KLD and employs MBBR (Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor) technology.

### 9.2.1 Detailed Feasibility Analysis for EACH Measure

**Industrial Process (WFI): Reject water recovery from RO plant.**

*   **Technical Feasibility**:
    *   This involves collecting the reject water from the Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant used for Water for Injection (WFI) production and treating it for reuse in less critical applications.
    *   Required Equipment:
        *   Collection tank with level sensors and pump controls.
        *   Filtration system (e.g., sand filter, activated carbon filter) to remove suspended solids and organic matter.
        *   Disinfection system (e.g., UV sterilizer) to ensure microbial purity.
        *   Piping and valves for conveying the recovered water to the point of use.
        *   Automation system for monitoring and controlling the entire recovery process.
    *   Piping Changes: New pipelines will be required from the RO reject outlet to the collection tank and from the treatment system to the point of use.
    *   Automation Needs: Level sensors in the collection tank, flow meters, and pressure sensors will be needed for automatic control and monitoring of the system. Integration with the existing SCADA system is recommended.
*   **Economic Analysis**:
    *   Let us assume cost for the additional infrastructure to be 20 Lakh INR.
    *   Operational cost including electricity, and maintenance to be 1 Lakh INR
    *   Water saving cost = 1825 kL/year * X INR/kL. We assume X = 50 INR/kL
    *   Total yearly saving is 1825 * 50 = 91250 INR, 9.1 Lakh INR
    *   ROI Calculation:
        *   ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) * 100

## Chapter 10: Conclusion

### 10.1 Overview of Audit Context

This comprehensive water audit was conducted by Climate AI Hub Auditing Services for Abaris Healthcare Pvt. Ltd., located in Rajpur, Taluka Kadi, Dist. Mehsana, Gujarat, for the period of 2023-24 to 2024-25. The audit, as mandated by CGWA NOC conditions considering the approved groundwater withdrawal of 100 KLD, aimed to provide a detailed assessment of the facility's water consumption patterns and to identify opportunities for improved water use efficiency. This assessment is critical for Abaris Healthcare to meet the regulatory requirement of reducing groundwater use by 20% within three years, as stipulated by CGWA. The methodology employed involved a thorough pre-audit data collection process, independent verification by our expert audit team, on-site measurements using calibrated instruments, and detailed discussions with key industry personnel.

### 10.2 Key Findings and Observations

The audit revealed valuable insights into Abaris Healthcare's water management practices. An assessment of the pharmaceutical manufacturing processes for IV Fluids and Injectables indicated that groundwater, treated through RO, forms the primary water source. The average daily fresh water consumption stands at 85 KLD, with an additional 15 KLD of recycled water utilized daily.

A technology assessment of the WFI generation, filling lines, ETP, and STP against Best Available Technologies (BAT) identified specific gaps. The multi-column distillation for WFI was noted as an area for potential improvement, with membrane-based cold WFI systems offering a more energy-efficient alternative. Furthermore, a utility system audit was recommended to thoroughly evaluate cooling towers, boilers, and blowdown controls, data for which was unavailable during the current audit.

Regarding wastewater management, the facility generates approximately 20,368 KL (2023-24) and 20,513 KL (2024-25) of wastewater annually, which is effectively treated through a 100 KLD ETP and a 20 KLD STP, with the treated water being recycled for gardening and floor washing purposes. This practice demonstrates a commitment to partial ZLD.

Data analysis revealed that the Specific Water Consumption (SWC) is currently 2.0 Liters/Bottle, slightly exceeding the industry benchmark of 1.8 Liters/Bottle. This indicates room for optimization in water usage per unit of production. Existing water conservation initiatives such as leak audits, staff training, and reuse of ETP-treated water showcase a proactive approach towards water conservation.

### 10.3 Water Conservation Strategy

The water conservation plan detailed in this report proposes several targeted measures to reduce water consumption across various areas of operation. These include:

*   **RO Reject Water Recovery:** Recovering reject water from the RO plant.
*   **Condensate Recovery:** Implementing systems to recover condensate from steam processes.
*   **Aerator Installation:** Installing aerators in taps to reduce domestic water consumption.
*   **Treated STP Water Usage:** Expanding the use of treated STP water for green belt irrigation.

These measures, as detailed in Chapter 9, have the potential to save approximately 32.5 KLD, translating to a significant reduction of 4562.5 kL/year in overall water consumption. This represents a substantial opportunity for Abaris Healthcare to reduce its reliance on groundwater and improve its water footprint.

### 10.4 Final Conclusion

Based on the findings of this water audit, conducted by Dr. Dhaval Patel of Climate AI Hub, it is evident that Abaris Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. has established a baseline for water management, but there remains considerable scope to enhance water use efficiency. The company is operating slightly above the industry benchmark in terms of Specific Water Consumption. The potential for savings identified through the proposed water conservation measures is significant.

Therefore, it is strongly recommended that Abaris Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. prioritizes the implementation of the water conservation plan outlined in this report. This proactive approach will not only contribute to reducing operational costs but also align the company with national water conservation goals and ensure long-term environmental sustainability. Successful implementation will enable Abaris Healthcare to comply with CGWA NOC conditions, reduce groundwater dependency, and solidify its position as a responsible and environmentally conscious organization.
