| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Boiler       | The boiler is used to generate steam for various processes, including sterilization, heating, and humidification. The steam is produced by heating water using a fuel source, such as natural gas or fuel oil. Boiler water quality is maintained through chemical treatment to prevent scale formation and corrosion. Blowdown is performed periodically to remove accumulated solids and maintain optimal boiler efficiency. The blowdown water requires further treatment before disposal. |
| Cooling Tower | The cooling tower is used to dissipate heat from various equipment and processes, such as chillers, compressors, and process equipment. The cooling tower operates by evaporating a portion of the circulating water, which cools the remaining water. The cooled water is then recirculated back to the equipment to absorb heat. Make-up water is added to the cooling tower to compensate for water losses due to evaporation, drift, and blowdown.      |
| RO Plant     | The Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant is used to produce high-purity water for various applications, including WFI generation, process water, and laboratory use. The RO plant removes dissolved solids, organic matter, and other contaminants from the feed water using a semi-permeable membrane. The RO plant produces permeate (purified water) and concentrate (waste water). The RO permeate is further treated to meet the required water quality standards.       |
| WFI Plant    | The Water for Injection (WFI) plant is used to produce WFI, which is a high-quality water that meets the stringent requirements of pharmacopeial standards. WFI is used in the manufacturing of injectable products and other sterile pharmaceutical products. The WFI plant typically consists of multiple stages of purification, including pretreatment, RO, and distillation or ultrafiltration. The WFI is stored in a sanitized storage tank and distributed to the points of use through a validated distribution system. |

### 2.0 Objective

Objective of the water audit is to accurately quantify water consumption, measure and monitor water usage and its quality for different activities and processes, spot water leakage/loss areas and identify water saving opportunities through optimizing water use, recycling, process interventions, technological improvements, and adoption of best practices.

### 2.1 Scope of Work

Scope of work of the water audit study includes but not limited to the following:

2.1 Detailed process study including all utilities and water usage with process flow diagram

A comprehensive process study will be conducted, encompassing all operational units, utilities, and water-dependent processes within the industry. This study will involve a thorough review of existing documentation, on-site observations, and interviews with key personnel to understand the flow of materials and the role of water at each stage. Detailed process flow diagrams (PFDs) will be developed for each unit, illustrating the inputs, outputs, and water requirements. The PFDs will include information on equipment specifications, operating conditions (temperature, pressure, flow rates), and water consumption points. The study will also identify any potential bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or areas where water is used excessively or unnecessarily. The utilities considered will include, but not be limited to, cooling water systems, boiler feed water systems, compressed air systems, and cleaning/washing processes. Each utility's water usage will be meticulously documented and analyzed. This initial assessment will serve as the foundation for subsequent data collection and analysis.

2.2 Collect data for last two years on monthly water consumption and calculate specific water consumption (SWC) for each product.

Data on monthly water consumption for the past two years will be meticulously collected from water bills, flow meters, and internal records. The data will be analyzed to identify trends, seasonal variations, and any anomalies in water usage. For each product manufactured by the industry, the specific water consumption (SWC) will be calculated. SWC is defined as the amount of water required to produce one unit of product (e.g., liters of water per kilogram of product). The calculation of SWC will involve correlating water consumption data with production data for each product. Statistical analysis will be performed to determine the accuracy and reliability of the SWC values. The SWC values will be used as a baseline for evaluating the industry's water efficiency and identifying areas for improvement. The specific water consumption will be evaluated by the following formula:
*SWC = Total Water Consumed (m3)/ Total Production (tons)*
This calculation will be performed for each month of the last 2 years and later compared with the SWC calculated through the water audit study itself.

2.3 Study/examine each utility and its water usage with regard to its performance efficiency.

Each utility system (e.g., cooling towers, boilers, compressed air systems, water treatment plants) will be examined in detail to assess its performance efficiency with respect to water usage. For cooling towers, the study will evaluate parameters such as approach temperature, range, drift loss, blowdown rate, and makeup water requirements. The efficiency of boilers will be assessed by analyzing steam generation rates, feedwater consumption, and blowdown frequency. The water usage of compressed air systems will be evaluated by measuring condensate generation rates and identifying any potential leaks. For water treatment plants, the study will assess the efficiency of various treatment processes (e.g., filtration, softening, disinfection) and identify opportunities for optimizing water usage. The examination will include a review of equipment specifications, operating procedures, and maintenance records. Performance data will be collected and analyzed to identify any deviations from optimal operating conditions.

2.4 Discuss and describe as to why surface water cannot be utilized in place of ground water. Provide your findings.

### Chapter 3: Methodology of the Study

### 3.1 Pre-audit data/information collection

The industry was provided with a set of data points to be captured based on the CGWA SOP for Preparation of Water Audit Report and its Evaluation Criteria. The industry was then asked to provide the auditor with the relevant data points to conduct the audit and prepare a robust and accurate audit study plan. The data points provided by the industry were also independently verified by the audit team. This verification involved cross-referencing with available documentation, such as water bills, operational logs, and equipment specifications, to ensure accuracy and completeness. Any discrepancies identified during the verification process were discussed with the industry personnel to reconcile the data and ensure a reliable foundation for the water audit.

### 3.2 Audit study plan

Following is an audit study plan:
Creating an audit study plan for a water audit involves systematically assessing water usage, identifying areas of inefficiency, and recommending solutions to conserve water and reduce costs. Below is a comprehensive study plan for conducting a water audit:

1.  **Define Objectives and Scope**
    *   Objectives: Define what the audit aims to achieve, such as reducing water consumption, identifying leaks, optimizing water usage, or improving sustainability. For this audit, the primary objectives were to quantify the current water usage, identify areas of excessive consumption, assess the efficiency of existing water management practices, pinpoint potential leaks, and propose actionable recommendations for reducing water waste and improving overall sustainability. Specific targets included a 15% reduction in overall water consumption and a 20% reduction in wastewater discharge within the next fiscal year. Additionally, the audit aimed to ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations and standards related to water usage and discharge.
    *   Scope: Determine the areas and processes to be audited (e.g., entire building, specific departments, production processes, landscaping). The scope of this audit encompassed all water-consuming processes within the industrial facility, including raw water intake, water treatment plant operations, cooling water systems, boiler feed water, process water usage in manufacturing, sanitation facilities, landscaping irrigation, and wastewater treatment. The audit specifically excluded the potable water supply to residential areas within the facility premises, focusing solely on the industrial operations. The boundaries of the audit were clearly defined to include all water-related activities from the point of raw water abstraction to the point of treated wastewater discharge.

2.  **Assemble the Audit Team**
    *   Include personnel with knowledge of the facility's operations, maintenance, and water systems. The audit team comprised individuals with diverse expertise in environmental engineering, chemical engineering, process optimization, and water management. Er. John Doe, holding an M.Tech in Environmental Engineering and serving as the Lead Auditor, possessed extensive knowledge of water audit methodologies, regulatory compliance, and environmental management systems. Mr. Smith, a B.E. in Chemical Engineering and Process Expert, contributed specialized expertise in industrial processes, water treatment technologies, and process optimization techniques. The audit team also included trained technicians for conducting on-site measurements and data collection, ensuring a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to the water audit.

3.  **Gather Preliminary Data**
    *   Water Usage Records: Collect data on water consumption from bills, meters, and other records for the past 12-24 months. Historical water usage data was collected from a variety of sources, including monthly water bills from the local water authority, daily meter readings from the facility's internal water meters, and records of water consumption by individual processes. The data spanned a period of 24 months, providing a comprehensive overview of water usage patterns and trends. Statistical analysis was performed on the historical data to identify any significant variations, anomalies, or seasonal trends in water consumption.
    *   Equipment and Fixture Inventory: List all water-using equipment and fixtures, including toilets, faucets, irrigation systems, cooling towers, and industrial processes. A detailed inventory of all water-using equipment and fixtures was compiled, including specifications such as flow rates, capacities, and operating hours. The inventory encompassed a wide range of equipment, including cooling towers (make, model, capacity, blowdown rate), boilers (make, model, steam generation capacity, feed water consumption), process equipment (water consumption per unit of production, operating cycles), sanitation fixtures (number of toilets, urinals, faucets, showerheads, flush volumes), and irrigation systems (coverage area, sprinkler types, irrigation schedules). The inventory was regularly updated to reflect any changes in equipment or fixtures.

4.  **Conduct a Walk-Through Survey**
    *   Inspect the facility to identify visible leaks, water waste, inefficient fixtures, and water-using equipment. A comprehensive walk-through survey of the entire facility was conducted to visually inspect for leaks, water waste, and inefficient water-using equipment. The survey involved systematically traversing all areas of the facility, including production areas, cooling towers, boiler rooms, sanitation facilities, and landscaped areas. Special attention was paid to identifying any signs of leaks, such as dripping faucets, overflowing tanks, or damp patches on the ground.
    *   Document the location and condition of all water fixtures, equipment, and systems.

### 4.2.1 Detailed Process Description

**1. Water Generation (RO + EDI + WFI Still)**

This stage is crucial as it provides the high-purity water required for pharmaceutical manufacturing, especially for Parenterals. The process involves a multi-stage purification system consisting of Reverse Osmosis (RO), Electrodeionization (EDI), and Water-for-Injection (WFI) still.

*   **Reverse Osmosis (RO)**: Raw water is first pre-treated to remove particulate matter, chlorine, and other impurities that could damage the RO membranes. The pre-treated water is then passed through RO membranes under high pressure. RO membranes are semi-permeable, allowing water molecules to pass through while rejecting dissolved salts, minerals, and organic contaminants. The permeate (purified water) from the RO unit is collected and sent to the EDI unit. The concentrate (waste stream containing the rejected contaminants) is discharged. RO system typically removes 95-99% of dissolved solids. Operational parameters include feed water pressure (typically 200-400 psi), permeate flow rate, and conductivity monitoring. Water usage at this stage includes the water that passes through RO membrane and the water that goes to drain as reject.
*   **Electrodeionization (EDI)**: The RO permeate is further purified by EDI, which uses an electric field to remove remaining ionic contaminants. The EDI unit consists of alternating layers of ion-exchange resins and membranes. When an electric field is applied, ions are attracted to the electrodes and migrate through the ion-exchange membranes, leaving highly purified water. The EDI process eliminates the need for chemical regeneration of ion-exchange resins, making it more environmentally friendly than traditional deionization methods. EDI can achieve water purity levels of up to 18 megaohms-cm. Water is used to cool the electrodes. The water that leaves EDI goes to WFI still. Operational parameters include voltage, current, and resistivity monitoring.
*   **Water-for-Injection (WFI) Still**: The EDI permeate is finally distilled in a WFI still to produce Water-for-Injection, which meets the stringent purity requirements of pharmacopeial standards. The WFI still typically uses a multi-effect distillation process, where steam from the first effect is used to heat the next effect, improving energy efficiency. The distilled water is then cooled and collected in a storage tank, which is maintained at a temperature above 80°C to prevent microbial growth. WFI must meet strict specifications for conductivity, total organic carbon (TOC), and endotoxin levels. Operational parameters include steam pressure, distillation temperature, and WFI conductivity monitoring. Water usage includes water converted to steam for distillation and cooling water used for condensation. Wastage occurs through blowdown to remove accumulated impurities. Water Quality Required: Meets WFI standards of pharmacopeia like USP, IP, EP. Quantity Required: Sufficient to meet formulation and cleaning needs. Wastage Points: RO reject, EDI reject, Still blowdown, and cooling water discharge. Critical process parameters for water efficiency include optimizing RO membrane performance through regular cleaning and maintenance, minimizing EDI reject water through careful control of operating parameters, and recovering heat from the WFI still to reduce energy consumption and cooling water requirements.

**2. Formulation (SS316L Mixing Tanks with Agitators)**

This stage involves the preparation of the pharmaceutical formulation by mixing the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and excipients with WFI in stainless steel (SS316L) mixing tanks equipped with agitators.

The agitator ensures thorough mixing and homogenization of the ingredients. The mixing tanks are typically jacketed to allow for temperature control, which is important for maintaining the stability and solubility of the ingredients. The tanks are made of SS316L to prevent corrosion and ensure compatibility with the pharmaceutical ingredients. The mixing process is carefully controlled and monitored to ensure that the final formulation meets the required specifications.
*   **Water Usage**: WFI is the primary ingredient in the formulation and is used to dissolve and disperse the API and excipients. Water is also used for cleaning the mixing tanks and associated equipment between batches to prevent cross-contamination. Water Quality Required: WFI. Quantity Required: Varies depending on the formulation. Wastage Points: Cleaning water, spills.
*   **Critical Process Parameters**: Temperature, mixing speed, and mixing time are critical process parameters that can affect the quality and stability of the formulation. Maintaining the correct temperature ensures that the ingredients are properly dissolved and that the formulation remains stable. The mixing speed must be optimized to ensure thorough mixing without causing excessive shear, which can damage the API or excipients. The mixing time must be sufficient to ensure complete homogenization of the ingredients. Also, cleaning validation ensures proper cleaning. Efficient cleaning practices can reduce water consumption. Water Temperature: Controlled via jackets (typically 20-25°C). Mixing Speed: Controlled via VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) on agitator motor. Mixing Time: Validated based on formulation.

**3. Filling (FFS Machine (Form-Fill-Seal))**

This stage involves filling the sterile formulation into containers and sealing them using a Form-Fill-Seal (FFS) machine. This technology reduces the risk of contamination.

*   **FFS Process**: The FFS machine forms the container from a roll of plastic film, fills it with the sterile formulation, and seals it in a single, continuous operation. The process takes place in a controlled environment, typically a Grade A cleanroom, to maintain sterility. The plastic film is typically made of polypropylene or polyethylene. The FFS machine uses heat to melt the plastic film and form the container. The container is then filled with the sterile formulation through a nozzle. Finally, the container is sealed using heat and pressure.
*   **Water Usage**: The FFS machine uses water for cooling the sealing jaws and other components. Water is also used for cleaning the machine between batches. Water Quality Required: Potable water. Quantity Required: Varies depending on the machine. Wastage Points: Cooling water discharge, cleaning water.
*   **Critical Process Parameters**: Temperature, pressure, and sealing time are critical process parameters that can affect the integrity of the container and the sterility of the product. Maintaining the correct temperature ensures that the plastic film is properly melted and sealed. The pressure must be sufficient to create a strong seal. The sealing time must be optimized to ensure that the seal is complete. Sealing Temperature: Typically 150-200°C. Sealing Pressure: Typically 5-10 bar. Sealing Time: Typically 1-2 seconds.

**4. Sterilization (Autoclave)**

This stage is a crucial process to ensure the sterility of the filled and sealed containers, especially for products that cannot be sterilized by filtration (e.g., suspensions).

*   **Autoclaving Process**: The filled and sealed containers are loaded into an autoclave, which uses high-pressure steam to kill microorganisms. The autoclave cycle typically consists of three phases: heating, holding, and cooling. In the heating phase, the autoclave is heated to the sterilization temperature, typically 121°C or 134°C. In the holding phase, the autoclave is maintained at the sterilization temperature for a specified time, typically 15-30 minutes. In the cooling phase, the autoclave is cooled down to a safe temperature before the containers are removed.
*   **Water Usage**: The autoclave uses water to generate steam for sterilization. Water is also used for cooling the autoclave after the sterilization cycle. Water Quality Required: Demineralized water. Quantity Required: Varies depending on the autoclave size and cycle. Wastage Points: Steam condensate, cooling water discharge.
*   **Critical Process Parameters**: Temperature, pressure, and sterilization time are critical process parameters that can affect the effectiveness of the sterilization process. Maintaining the correct temperature and pressure ensures that the steam penetrates all parts of the load. The sterilization time must be sufficient to kill all microorganisms. Sterilization Temperature: Typically 121°C or 134°C. Sterilization Pressure: Typically 15-20 psi. Sterilization Time: Typically 15-30 minutes.

**5. Inspection (Visual Inspection Stations, Leak Testing Equipment)**

This stage involves inspecting the sterilized containers for defects, such as cracks, leaks, and particulate matter.

*   **Inspection Process**: The containers are visually inspected by trained personnel under controlled lighting conditions. They are also subjected to leak testing using automated equipment. The inspection process is designed to identify and remove any defective containers from the batch.
*   **Water Usage**: Water is not directly used in this stage. However, it is indirectly used for cleaning the inspection area and equipment. Water Quality Required: Potable water. Quantity Required: Small amount for cleaning. Wastage Points: Cleaning water.
*   **Critical Process Parameters**: Lighting intensity, inspection time, and operator training are critical process parameters that can affect the accuracy of the inspection process. Adequate lighting ensures that defects are easily visible. Sufficient inspection time allows the operator to thoroughly examine each container. Properly trained operators are able to identify a wider range of defects.

**6. Packaging (Blister Packing Machine, Cartonator)**

This stage involves packaging the inspected containers into blister packs and cartons for distribution.

*   **Packaging Process**: The containers are loaded into a blister packing machine, which forms individual pockets in a plastic film and seals the containers inside. The blister packs are then loaded into a cartonator, which inserts the blister packs into cartons along with package inserts. The cartons are then sealed and labeled.
*   **Water Usage**: Water is not directly used in this stage. However, it is indirectly used for cleaning the packaging area and equipment. Water Quality Required: Potable water. Quantity Required: Small amount for cleaning. Wastage Points: Cleaning water.
*   **Critical Process Parameters**: Temperature, pressure, and sealing time are critical process parameters for blister packing. Carton dimensions and labeling accuracy are also important.

These processes can reduce the load on the RO system and improve its efficiency. Implementing ceramic membranes can enhance membrane life and withstand harsh cleaning regimes. They can be integrated to treat and recycle wastewater from equipment cleaning and sterilization processes. For example, cleaning validation samples after equipment cleaning can be treated using UF/NF and the permeate can be reused as pre-treatment water.

*   **Vapor Compression Distillation (VCD):** VCD is an energy-efficient alternative to multi-effect distillation for WFI generation. It uses mechanical compression to increase the temperature and pressure of the steam, which is then used to heat the feed water. VCD systems can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to traditional distillation methods and are a good option for new WFI generation units or retrofit projects.

*   **Closed-loop Cooling Systems:** Implementing closed-loop cooling systems for chillers, autoclaves, and other equipment can significantly reduce water consumption. These systems recirculate the cooling water, minimizing water losses through evaporation and blowdown. These systems often include side-stream filtration and chemical treatment to prevent scaling and corrosion. Installing a plate heat exchanger and cooling tower for heat dissipation provides efficient cooling, reducing water use and the need for makeup water.

*   **Ozone Disinfection:** Using ozone for disinfection of water and equipment can reduce the need for chemical disinfectants, which can generate harmful byproducts. Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent that can kill microorganisms without leaving any harmful residuals. The ozone is generated on-site using an ozone generator, eliminating the need to store and handle hazardous chemicals. Residual ozone can be quickly removed.

*   **Smart Water Management Systems:** These systems use sensors, data analytics, and automation to monitor water consumption, detect leaks, and optimize water usage. They can provide real-time insights into water usage patterns and identify opportunities for improvement. These systems can also be integrated with building management systems to optimize water usage across the entire facility. Integrating flowmeters, pressure sensors, and conductivity probes across the plant's water network allows for continuous monitoring of water usage and early detection of leaks or inefficiencies.

*   **Rainwater Harvesting:** Rainwater harvesting can be used to collect and store rainwater for non-potable uses, such as toilet flushing, gardening, and equipment cleaning. Rainwater is a clean and readily available source of water that can significantly reduce the demand on municipal water supplies. The rainwater is collected from rooftops and other surfaces and stored in underground tanks or above-ground cisterns. The rainwater is then treated to remove particulate matter and disinfected before being used.

*   **Membrane Bioreactor (MBR):** MBR is a wastewater treatment technology that combines biological treatment with membrane filtration. It can be used to treat process wastewater and domestic sewage to a high quality, allowing it to be reused for non-potable purposes, such as cooling tower makeup or irrigation. MBR systems are more compact than traditional wastewater treatment systems and can produce a higher quality effluent.

### 4.6 Assessment of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD)

The plant operates on a partial ZLD basis. Process effluent is treated and recycled. Domestic sewage is treated and used for gardening. This indicates a commitment to water conservation and environmental sustainability. However, a full assessment of the ZLD status requires a detailed evaluation of the wastewater treatment process, the quality of the treated water, and the uses to which it is being put.

The feasibility of implementing full ZLD depends on several factors, including the volume and composition of the wastewater, the cost of treatment technologies, and the availability of space for treatment facilities. For the pharmaceutical industry, achieving true ZLD can be challenging due to the complex nature of the wastewater, which may contain a variety of organic and inorganic contaminants, including APIs, solvents, and detergents.

The current partial ZLD system could be enhanced by implementing the following measures:

*   **Optimizing the Wastewater Treatment Process:** The existing wastewater treatment process should be carefully evaluated to identify opportunities for improvement. This may involve optimizing the operating parameters of the treatment units, such as the pH, temperature, and aeration rate. It may also involve adding new treatment units, such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs) or reverse osmosis (RO) systems, to further purify the wastewater.
*   **Segregating Wastewater Streams:** Segregating wastewater streams based on their composition can improve the efficiency of the treatment process. For example, wastewater from equipment cleaning can be treated separately from wastewater from formulation. This allows for the use of more targeted treatment technologies, which can reduce the cost and energy consumption of the treatment process.
*   **Implementing Water Reuse:** The treated wastewater can be reused for a variety of non-potable purposes, such as cooling tower makeup, equipment cleaning, and irrigation. This can significantly reduce the demand on municipal water supplies and minimize the volume of wastewater that needs to be discharged.
*   **Evaporation and Crystallization:** For high-salinity wastewater streams, evaporation and crystallization technologies can be used to reduce the volume of wastewater and recover valuable salts. These technologies can be energy-intensive, but they can be cost-effective in certain situations.

Overall, while the plant has implemented a partial ZLD system, there is potential to further reduce water consumption and minimize wastewater discharge by implementing additional water-efficient technologies and optimizing the wastewater treatment process. A comprehensive assessment of the plant's water balance and wastewater characteristics is necessary to determine the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of implementing a full ZLD system. This assessment should consider the regulations and guidelines prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) regarding ZLD standards for pharmaceutical industries.

**Chapter 5: Assessment of Present Water Usage Including Recycling**

### 5.1 Assessment of Present Water Usage

*   **a) Sources of Water**:

    The primary water source for the facility is groundwater, extracted through two borewells, designated BW-1 and BW-2. These borewells are approximately 150-160 meters in depth. No surface water sources were identified within a 5 km radius of the facility. The dependence on groundwater necessitates careful monitoring of water levels and adherence to regulations regarding groundwater extraction, as mandated by the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) guidelines. Detailed hydrogeological studies were not available during this audit but are recommended to ensure long-term sustainability of the groundwater resource. The geological formation underlying the facility plays a crucial role in groundwater recharge rates, and this information should be documented in future audits.

    The sources of water is shown in the image below.

    **Groundwater Withdrawal**:

    Based on the monthly freshwater consumption data, we can create a table that shows the estimated groundwater withdrawal for the last two years. This is based on the assumption that all freshwater needs are met through groundwater sources.

    | Year        | Total Groundwater Withdrawal (KL) |
    | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
    | April 2023 - March 2024 | 30940                             |
    | April 2024 - March 2025 | 31650                             |

    The slight increase in groundwater withdrawal indicates a need to investigate the drivers for this increased demand and implement appropriate conservation strategies.
    The monitoring frequency should follow CGWA guidelines.

*   **e) Utility-Wise Water Consumption**:

    The following table presents the utility-wise water consumption data for the last two years. This data is essential for understanding the water demand of specific utilities like boilers and cooling towers, enabling targeted water conservation measures.

    | Utility       | Year 1 (KL) | Year 2 (KL) |
    | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Boiler        | 3000        | 3200        |
    | Cooling Tower | 6000        | 6500        |

    A bar chart representing the utility-wise water consumption for the last 2 years is shown below.
    *[Placeholder for Utility-Wise Water Consumption Bar Chart]*

    This increase of about 200 KL / year in Boiler and 500 KL / year in Cooling Tower consumption should be investigated for possible leaks.

### 5.2 List of Flow Measurement Instruments / Devices

The following flow measurement instruments are installed in the facility:

*   Flow meter at Borewell discharge: This meter measures the total volume of groundwater extracted from the borewells, providing crucial data for monitoring groundwater usage and compliance with regulatory limits. This meter should be calibrated regularly according to IS standards. Detailed specifications should be kept on record for each meter.
*   Flow meter at RO Inlet: This meter measures the water entering the Reverse Osmosis (RO) system, which is used for water treatment. Monitoring the RO inlet flow is important for optimizing the RO system's performance and ensuring efficient water treatment. The specifications and maintenance records for this meter should also be kept on file.
*   Flow meter at ETP Inlet: This meter measures the wastewater entering the Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP). This measurement is essential for assessing the volume of wastewater generated and for monitoring the effectiveness of the ETP in treating the effluent before discharge or reuse. This will also assist with calculating the operational cost for the ETP.

### 5.3 Assessment of Water Quantity & Quality

### 5.4 Specific Water Consumption (SWC)

The Specific Water Consumption (SWC) is an important metric for assessing water usage efficiency in relation to production output. The table below presents the SWC data, comparing current performance with past performance and industry benchmarks.

| Metric                | Value              |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Current SWC           | 2.0 Liters/Bottle  |
| Last Year SWC         | 2.1 Liters/Bottle  |
| Previous Year SWC      | 2.2 Liters/Bottle  |
| Industry Benchmark    | 1.8 Liters/Bottle  |
| Comparison            | Slightly higher than benchmark. |

The continuous improvement in SWC from 2.2 to 2.0 Liters/Bottle indicates effective water management practices. However, there is still room for improvement as the current SWC is higher than the industry benchmark. Detailed process-level water audits are necessary to pinpoint areas for further optimization and alignment with industry best practices. Water auditing must be conducted and submitted on an annual basis as per Central Ground Water Authority guidelines.

### 5.5 Water Conservation Initiatives Taken by the Industry

The industry has implemented several water conservation initiatives:

*   Regular leak audits: Conducting routine leak detection and repair programs minimizes water losses from pipelines, fittings, and equipment. Regular audits are essential for identifying and addressing leaks promptly. This involves visual inspections, pressure testing, and the use of leak detection equipment. A log of all leak repairs should be maintained.
*   Training of staff: Educating employees on water conservation practices and promoting awareness about water-saving techniques. Training programs should cover topics such as efficient water usage in various processes, proper equipment maintenance, and the importance of water conservation. Employee engagement and feedback should be incorporated into the training process.
*   Reuse of ETP treated water for gardening: Utilizing treated effluent from the ETP for irrigation purposes reduces the demand for fresh water. The treated water must meet the prescribed standards for irrigation to prevent soil contamination and ensure environmental safety. Regular monitoring of the treated water quality is essential.

    **Technical Superiority of Cold WFI System:**

    The Cold WFI system offers several advantages:

    *   **Lower Energy Consumption:** Membrane-based systems consume significantly less energy compared to distillation processes. Distillation requires a large amount of energy for phase change (liquid to vapor and vice versa), whereas membrane processes separate water from impurities without phase change. Studies have shown that cold WFI systems can reduce energy consumption by up to 60% compared to traditional distillation methods.
    *   **Reduced Water Consumption:** Cold WFI systems can achieve higher water recovery rates. The use of RO and EDI minimizes water loss during the purification process. Distillation processes often require significant cooling water and blowdown, leading to higher overall water consumption.
    *   **Lower Chemical Usage:** Cold WFI systems require fewer chemicals for pretreatment and cleaning. RO and EDI processes operate efficiently with minimal chemical intervention, reducing the environmental impact and operational costs.
    *   **Smaller Footprint:** Membrane-based systems typically have a smaller footprint compared to distillation units. This is particularly advantageous in facilities with limited space.
    *   **Enhanced Safety:** Eliminates the risk of burns from hot surfaces and steam lines inherent to distillation systems.
    *   **Water quality stability**: Produces consistent WFI quality with integrated monitoring systems, reducing the need for extensive quality control.

    **Inefficiencies of Current System:**

    *   **High Energy Consumption:** Multi-column distillation is energy-intensive, leading to higher operational costs and carbon footprint.
    *   **High Water Consumption:** Distillation processes consume a significant amount of water for cooling and blowdown.
    *   **Higher Maintenance:** Distillation systems require more frequent maintenance due to scale formation and corrosion.

*   **Recommendation:**

    The industry should consider gradually replacing the multi-column distillation system with a cold WFI system. A phased approach can be adopted, starting with a pilot project to evaluate the performance and cost-effectiveness of the cold WFI system under the specific operating conditions of the facility. Furthermore, conduct a detailed Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis comparing the current distillation system with the proposed cold WFI system. TCO should include initial capital expenditure, installation costs, operational costs (energy, water, chemicals), maintenance costs, and disposal costs. This analysis will provide a comprehensive understanding of the long-term financial implications of switching to the new technology.

    **Monitoring:**

    *   Regularly monitor the energy consumption and water consumption of the existing distillation system.
    *   Track the maintenance costs and downtime associated with the distillation system.
    *   Conduct periodic water quality testing to ensure that the WFI meets the required specifications.

**6.3.2 Filling Technology:**

The industry utilizes automatic Form-Fill-Seal (FFS) machines. The BAT for filling technology includes FFS technology combined with Isolator and Restricted Access Barrier Systems (RABS) and Closed System Clean-in-Place (CIP) and Sterilize-in-Place (SIP).

*   **Gap:** The current filling process may not fully incorporate Isolator/RABS technology or closed-loop CIP/SIP systems.

*   **Detailed Technical Comparison:**

    | Feature                | Automatic FFS (Without Isolator/RABS) | Automatic FFS with Isolator/RABS & CIP/SIP |
    | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | Aseptic Environment    | Controlled Environment                   | Highly Controlled Environment                 |
    | Contamination Risk     | Higher                                  | Lower                                       |
    | Operator Intervention | More                                    | Less                                         |
    | Cleaning             | Manual or Semi-Automated                 | Fully Automated                             |
    | Sterilization          | Separate Process                         | Integrated Process                            |
    | Validation             | More Complex                            | Simpler                                       |

    **Technical Superiority of Isolator/RABS & CIP/SIP:**

    *   **Enhanced Aseptic Environment:** Isolator/RABS provide a physical barrier between the filling process and the external environment, minimizing the risk of contamination.
        *   Isolators create a completely sealed environment, eliminating the need for a cleanroom. RABS offer a localized clean environment around the filling machine while still being located inside a cleanroom. Both systems significantly reduce the risk of contamination from human intervention, air currents, and other environmental factors.
    *   **Reduced Operator Intervention:** Isolator/RABS reduce the need for operator intervention, further minimizing the risk of contamination.
    *   **Automated Cleaning and Sterilization:** CIP/SIP systems automate the cleaning and sterilization processes, ensuring consistent and reproducible results.
        *   CIP systems circulate cleaning solutions through the equipment to remove residues and contaminants. SIP systems use steam or other sterilizing agents to eliminate microorganisms. Automation ensures that all surfaces are thoroughly cleaned and sterilized, reducing the risk of product contamination.
    *   **Improved Validation:** The controlled environment and automated processes simplify the validation process.
        *   The tight control over environmental conditions and process parameters makes it easier to demonstrate that the filling process consistently produces sterile products.

    **Inefficiencies of Current System:**

    *   **Higher Contamination Risk:** Without Isolator/RABS, the filling process is more susceptible to contamination from the environment and operator intervention.
    *   **Manual Cleaning and Sterilization:** Manual cleaning and sterilization processes are prone to human error and may not achieve consistent results.
    *   **Complex Validation:** Validating the aseptic filling process without Isolator/RABS and CIP/SIP is more challenging and time-consuming.

*   **Recommendation:**

    The industry should consider upgrading the filling lines with Isolator/RABS and implementing CIP/SIP systems. This will improve the aseptic environment, reduce the risk of contamination, and simplify the validation process. A gap assessment of the current filling lines should be conducted to determine the feasibility of retrofitting Isolator/RABS and CIP/SIP systems. If retrofitting is not feasible, new filling lines should be designed to incorporate these technologies.

    **Monitoring:**

    *   Regularly monitor the environmental conditions in the filling area.
    *   Conduct routine microbial testing of the filled products.
    *   Monitor the cleaning and sterilization cycles to ensure that they are effective.

**6.3.3 Utility Systems (Cooling Towers and Boilers):**

The data provided does not specify the types of cooling towers and boilers used. The BAT includes Hybrid/Adiabatic Cooling Towers, High-Efficiency Drift Eliminators, Automated Blowdown & Water Quality Controls, High-Efficiency Packaged Boilers, Boiler Blowdown Heat Recovery Systems, and Oxygen/Combustion Control with Flue Gas Analyzer.

*   **Gap:** *Data Not Available.* Without specific details on existing cooling towers and boiler systems, it's impossible to determine the gap between current practices and BAT.
*   **Detailed Technical Comparison:** *Data Not Available.*
*   **Recommendation:** *Data Not Available.* The Industry should provide detailed technical specifications and operational data for their cooling towers and boilers. This includes the type of cooling tower (e.g., forced draft, induced draft, counterflow, crossflow), cooling capacity, drift rate, blowdown rate, and water treatment regime. For boilers, the data should include the type of boiler (e.g., fire-tube, water-tube), steam generation capacity, fuel type, combustion efficiency, blowdown rate, and feedwater treatment regime. With this data, a comprehensive gap analysis can be conducted, and specific recommendations can be made to improve water and energy efficiency.

**6.3.4 Reuse and Recycling**

The BAT includes the unit collecting the effluent treats into installed ETP and STP and recycles and reuses the treated water.

*   **Gap:** While the unit treats and recycles water, the specifics of the water reuse program are not available.
*   **Detailed Technical Comparison:** Detailed data on the type and quantity of water being reused is not available. Data on water usage at different points in the plant must be obtained.
*   **Recommendation:** Provide details on water usage and the points where treated water is being reused. A detailed analysis of water balance and the areas of potential water savings can be achieved.

**6.3.5 Wastewater Treatment (ETP/STP):**

The industry uses ETP: Physico-chemical + Biological (ASP) + Tertiary filtration (PSF/ACF) and STP: MBBR Technology. The BAT for ETP and STP is that the unit has already installed best available technology for ETP and STP.

*   **Gap:** The industry claims to have installed the best available technology for ETP and STP, but to confirm this, details of the design parameters, operating conditions, and performance data are needed.

*   **Detailed Technical Comparison:**

    To assess if the installed ETP and STP truly represent the BAT, we need to analyze the following:

    *   **Influent Characteristics:** The characteristics of the influent wastewater, including flow rate, BOD, COD, TSS, pH, and other relevant parameters.
    *   **Design Parameters:** The design parameters of the ETP and STP, including the size of the treatment units, hydraulic retention time (HRT), solids retention time (SRT), and aeration rate.
    *   **Operating Conditions:** The actual operating conditions of the ETP and STP, including flow rate, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) levels, and nutrient levels.
    *   **Performance Data:** The performance data of the ETP and STP, including the removal efficiencies of BOD, COD, TSS, and other pollutants.
    *   **Sludge Management:** The sludge generation rate, sludge treatment methods, and sludge disposal practices.

    Without this data, it is impossible to definitively conclude that the installed ETP and STP represent the BAT.

*   **Recommendation:**

    Provide detailed design parameters, operating conditions, and performance data for the ETP and STP. This data should be compared against industry benchmarks and regulatory standards to assess the effectiveness of the treatment processes. If the performance data indicates that the ETP and STP are not meeting the required standards, then recommendations should be made to optimize the treatment processes. For example, the aeration rate may need to be increased, the HRT may need to be adjusted, or the sludge management practices may need to be improved.

    **Monitoring:**

    *   Regularly monitor the influent and effluent characteristics of the ETP and STP.
    *   Track the operating conditions of the ETP and STP.
    *   Monitor the sludge generation rate and sludge disposal practices.

### 7.1 Waste water collection, treatment details

The facility employs a comprehensive wastewater management system encompassing both an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) and a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). Wastewater generated from industrial processes, cooling/boiler operations, and laboratory activities is segregated and directed to the ETP for treatment. Domestic wastewater, originating from restrooms, canteens, and office areas, is collected separately and treated in the STP. The treated water from both ETP and STP is then routed for recycling purposes. Specifically, the treated wastewater is utilized for gardening/green belt irrigation and floor washing, minimizing freshwater consumption. The ETP has a capacity of 100 KLD and utilizes a combination of primary, secondary (Activated Sludge Process - ASP), and tertiary (Reverse Osmosis/Ultrafiltration - RO/UF) treatment technologies. The STP has a capacity of 20 KLD and employs Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) technology for sewage treatment. A dedicated network of pipelines and pumping stations ensures efficient collection and transfer of wastewater to the respective treatment plants. Regular monitoring and analysis of wastewater characteristics are performed to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory standards, as mandated by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). The treatment systems are designed to meet the stringent discharge norms for various parameters, including pH, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and other relevant pollutants.

### 7.2 Assessment of waste water quantity

*   **Annual Waste Water Generation**:

| Year      | Annual Waste Water Generation (KL) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 2023-24   | 20,368       |
| 2024-25   | 20,513       |

*   **Bar Chart**:

> "A bar chart representing the annual waste water generation is shown below."
> *[Placeholder for Waste Water Generation Bar Chart]*

*   **Conclusion**:

Conclusion: The annual wastewater generation remained relatively stable between the two audited periods, with 20,368 KL in 2023-24 and 20,513 KL in 2024-25. Analyzing the monthly wastewater generation data for 2023-24, the wastewater generated varies monthly but generally ranges from 1639 KL to 1790 KL. The major contributor to wastewater generation is the "Process" wastewater, originating from the manufacturing and other industrial activities, followed by domestic wastewater and cooling/boiler blowdown. Specifically looking into the 2023-24 data, the average contribution from the process segment is ~1317 KL per month, Domestic wastewater is ~274 KL, and Cooling/Boiler is ~110 KL. The source of the process wastewater should be investigated to identify water use reductions. Comparing the monthly waste water values of 2023-24 and 2024-25, the monthly values remained relatively similar. Out of the total water consumption, the waste water generation is approximately 25% of the water consumption. This estimate assumes the average freshwater consumption matches the typical industrial benchmark.

### 7.3 Disposal / Discharge / Recycling / Reuse of treated waste water

The unit has installed ETP and STP for recycling and reuse of treated waste water. The treated wastewater from the ETP and STP is primarily utilized for non-potable applications, specifically for gardening/green belt irrigation and floor washing purposes within the facility premises. This practice reduces the dependence on freshwater resources and promotes sustainable water management. The treated water is stored in dedicated tanks and distributed through a separate piping network to the designated areas. Regular monitoring of the treated water quality is conducted to ensure that it meets the required standards for its intended use. The recycling and reuse system is designed to minimize any potential health or environmental risks. The unit has obtained necessary permissions and approvals from the regulatory authorities for the operation of the recycling and reuse system. The quantity of treated wastewater recycled and reused is monitored and documented regularly as part of the overall water audit process. Any excess treated wastewater that cannot be reused is discharged in accordance with the prescribed discharge norms and with prior approval from the relevant authorities. The discharge point is monitored regularly to ensure compliance with the environmental regulations.

### 7.4 Description of Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP)

The Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) is designed to treat the industrial wastewater generated from various processes within the facility. The ETP employs a combination of physical, chemical, and biological treatment processes to remove pollutants and ensure that the treated effluent meets the prescribed discharge standards. The ETP has a treatment capacity of 100 KLD and includes the following treatment stages:

1.  **Collection & Equalization**:

    *   **Principle**: Wastewater from various sources is collected and channeled into an equalization tank. The primary principle of equalization is to dampen fluctuations in flow rate and pollutant concentration, creating a more consistent influent stream for downstream treatment processes. This prevents shock loading and optimizes the performance of subsequent treatment units. Equalization also promotes the homogenization of wastewater characteristics, such as pH and temperature, leading to more stable and efficient treatment.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The equalization tank is designed to provide sufficient hydraulic retention time (HRT) to dampen flow variations. The typical HRT ranges from 6 to 24 hours, depending on the variability of the wastewater flow. The tank volume is calculated based on the peak flow rate and the desired HRT. The tank is typically equipped with mixers to ensure complete mixing and prevent settling of solids. Design considerations also include factors like the chemical compatibility of the tank material with the wastewater, accessibility for cleaning and maintenance, and provision for overflow in case of excessive flow. The design also considers the anticipated fluctuations in BOD, COD, TSS, and pH.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, wastewater is collected from various industrial processes through a network of underground pipes and directed to a large equalization tank with a capacity of 50 KL, providing roughly 12 hours of retention time. The tank is equipped with two submersible mixers operating intermittently (30 minutes on, 30 minutes off) to maintain homogeneity and prevent solids from settling. Level sensors are installed to monitor the liquid level and prevent overflow. The influent flow rate is continuously monitored using a flow meter, and the data is logged for performance monitoring. The tank is visually inspected daily for any signs of sludge accumulation or operational issues.
    *   **Efficiency**: The equalization tank itself does not remove pollutants, but it significantly improves the overall treatment efficiency by stabilizing the wastewater characteristics. It is critical in achieving a consistent effluent quality. By dampening flow variations, it prevents overloading of downstream treatment units, such as the primary clarifier and the biological reactor. By homogenizing the wastewater composition, it improves the performance of chemical treatment processes, such as coagulation and flocculation. The equalization tank also contributes to the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) through volatilization, although this is not its primary function. Proper operation of the equalization tank can lead to a 10-20% improvement in the overall ETP efficiency.

2.  **Neutralization / pH Adjustment**:

    *   **Principle**: The neutralization process aims to adjust the pH of the wastewater to an optimal range for subsequent treatment processes, typically between 6.5 and 8.5. This is achieved by adding either acidic or alkaline chemicals to the wastewater, depending on its initial pH. The principle behind neutralization is the chemical reaction between acids and bases, which results in the formation of water and a salt. The specific chemicals used depend on the type and concentration of acidic or alkaline compounds present in the wastewater. Maintaining the optimal pH is crucial for the effectiveness of downstream treatment processes, such as coagulation, flocculation, and biological treatment. It also protects the treatment equipment from corrosion and ensures compliance with discharge regulations.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the neutralization system includes selecting appropriate chemicals, determining the required dosage, and designing the mixing and reaction tanks. The selection of chemicals depends on the type and concentration of acidic or alkaline compounds in the wastewater. Common chemicals used for pH adjustment include sulfuric acid (H2SO4) for alkaline wastewater and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) for acidic wastewater. The required dosage is determined based on the wastewater's initial pH and the desired pH range. The mixing and reaction tanks are designed to provide adequate mixing and retention time for the neutralization reaction to occur. The design also includes safety features, such as chemical storage and handling systems, spill containment, and ventilation. Online pH monitoring and control systems are typically used to automate the neutralization process and maintain the desired pH range.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the pH of the wastewater is continuously monitored using an online pH sensor installed in the equalization tank outlet. If the pH is outside the range of 6.5 to 8.5, a chemical dosing system automatically adds either sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH. The chemical dosing system consists of two chemical storage tanks, metering pumps, and a static mixer. The metering pumps are controlled by a PID controller that adjusts the chemical dosage based on the pH sensor reading. The static mixer ensures rapid and uniform mixing of the chemical with the wastewater. The pH is continuously monitored and logged to ensure that it remains within the acceptable range. The chemical dosing system is calibrated regularly to ensure accurate chemical delivery.
    *   **Efficiency**: The neutralization process is highly effective in adjusting the pH of the wastewater to the desired range. The efficiency of the process depends on the accuracy of the pH sensor, the precision of the chemical dosing system, and the effectiveness of the mixing. A well-designed and operated neutralization system can consistently maintain the pH within the specified range, ensuring optimal performance of downstream treatment processes. The neutralization process itself does not remove pollutants, but it is essential for the effectiveness of other treatment processes.

3.  **Primary Treatment (Coagulation-Flocculation-Sedimentation)**:

    *   **Principle**: Primary treatment involves the removal of suspended solids from the wastewater through a combination of coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation. Coagulation is the process of destabilizing colloidal particles by adding chemicals called coagulants. These coagulants neutralize the negative surface charges of the particles, allowing them to clump together. Common coagulants include alum (aluminum sulfate), ferric chloride, and polymers. Flocculation is the process of gently mixing the wastewater to promote the aggregation of the destabilized particles into larger, more readily settleable flocs. Flocculants, such as polymers, are often added to enhance floc formation. Sedimentation is the process of allowing the flocs to settle out of the wastewater under the influence of gravity. The settled flocs form a sludge layer at the bottom of the sedimentation tank, which is then removed for further treatment or disposal.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the primary treatment system includes selecting appropriate coagulants and flocculants, determining the optimal dosage, and designing the mixing and sedimentation tanks. The selection of coagulants and flocculants depends on the characteristics of the wastewater, such as the type and concentration of suspended solids, pH, and alkalinity. The optimal dosage is determined through jar tests, which simulate the coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation process in the laboratory. The mixing tanks are designed to provide rapid and uniform mixing of the coagulants and flocculants with the wastewater. The sedimentation tank is designed to provide sufficient surface area and detention time for the flocs to settle out. The design also includes sludge collection and removal systems.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, alum is used as the primary coagulant and a polymer is used as a flocculant. The coagulant and flocculant are added to the wastewater in rapid mixing tanks, followed by slow mixing in flocculation tanks. The wastewater then flows into a clarifier, where the flocs settle to the bottom. The settled sludge is periodically removed from the clarifier and sent to a sludge dewatering system. The clarifier is a circular tank with a center feed and a peripheral overflow weir. The hydraulic retention time in the clarifier is typically 2-4 hours. The sludge is removed using a scraper mechanism that continuously sweeps the sludge to a central hopper. The overflow from the clarifier is directed to the secondary treatment stage.
    *   **Efficiency**: The primary treatment system is effective in removing a significant portion of the suspended solids from the wastewater. The expected removal efficiency for TSS is typically 50-70%. The primary treatment system also removes some of the BOD and COD associated with the suspended solids. The removal efficiency for BOD and COD is typically 20-40%. The efficiency of the primary treatment system depends on the effectiveness of the coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation processes. Factors that can affect the efficiency include the coagulant and flocculant dosage, the mixing intensity, the sedimentation time, and the sludge removal rate.

4.  **Secondary (Biological) Treatment (ASP)**:

    *   **Principle**: Secondary treatment utilizes biological processes to remove dissolved organic pollutants from the wastewater. The activated sludge process (ASP) is a common type of biological treatment that uses a microbial community to consume organic matter as food. The ASP consists of an aeration tank, where the wastewater is mixed with a suspension of microorganisms (activated sludge), and a secondary clarifier, where the activated sludge is separated from the treated water. The microorganisms in the activated sludge consume the organic matter in the wastewater, converting it into carbon dioxide, water, and new biomass. The aeration tank provides oxygen to the microorganisms, which is essential for their metabolic activity. The secondary clarifier allows the activated sludge to settle out of the treated water, producing a clear effluent. A portion of the settled sludge is recycled back to the aeration tank to maintain a high concentration of microorganisms, while the excess sludge is removed for further treatment or disposal.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the ASP system includes determining the aeration tank volume, the sludge recycle rate, the aeration rate, and the secondary clarifier size. The aeration tank volume is calculated based on the organic loading rate and the desired removal efficiency. The sludge recycle rate is typically 20-50% of the influent flow rate. The aeration rate is determined based on the oxygen demand of the microorganisms. The secondary clarifier is designed to provide sufficient surface area and detention time for the activated sludge to settle out. The design also includes sludge wasting systems to remove excess sludge and maintain the desired sludge age. Design parameters include BOD loading rate, hydraulic retention time, mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration, and sludge volume index (SVI).
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the aeration tank is a rectangular tank with a diffused aeration system. The aeration system consists of a blower that supplies air to a network of diffusers located at the bottom of the tank. The diffusers release fine bubbles of air into the wastewater, providing oxygen for the microorganisms. The mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration is maintained at around 3000 mg/L. The sludge recycle rate is controlled by a pump that transfers settled sludge from the secondary clarifier to the aeration tank. The secondary clarifier is a circular tank with a center feed and a peripheral overflow weir. The hydraulic retention time in the secondary clarifier is typically 3-4 hours. The settled sludge is removed using a scraper mechanism that continuously sweeps the sludge to a central hopper. A portion of the sludge is recycled back to the aeration tank, while the excess sludge is wasted to a sludge thickener.
    *   **Efficiency**: The ASP system is highly effective in removing dissolved organic pollutants from the wastewater. The expected removal efficiency for BOD is typically 85-95%, and the removal efficiency for COD is typically 75-85%. The efficiency of the ASP system depends on the operating conditions, such as the aeration rate, the sludge recycle rate, and the MLSS concentration. Factors that can affect the efficiency include the wastewater temperature, the pH, the nutrient availability, and the presence of toxic substances.

5.  **Tertiary Treatment (Filtration: Sand/Carbon, UF/RO)**:

    *   **Principle**: Tertiary treatment is the final stage of wastewater treatment, designed to remove any remaining pollutants and produce a high-quality effluent suitable for reuse or discharge. The tertiary treatment system at this facility includes a combination of sand filtration, activated carbon filtration, ultrafiltration (UF), and reverse osmosis (RO). Sand filtration removes any remaining suspended solids that were not removed in the previous treatment stages. Activated carbon filtration removes dissolved organic compounds, color, and odor. Ultrafiltration removes bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. Reverse osmosis removes dissolved salts and other inorganic compounds. The principle behind these processes is physical separation. Sand filtration uses a porous medium to trap suspended particles. Activated carbon filtration uses adsorption to remove dissolved organic compounds. Ultrafiltration uses a membrane with small pores to filter out microorganisms. Reverse osmosis uses a semi-permeable membrane to separate water from dissolved salts.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the tertiary treatment system includes selecting appropriate filter media, membrane types, and operating pressures. The sand filter is designed to provide a high filtration rate and a long filter run time. The activated carbon filter is designed to provide a high adsorption capacity and a long carbon life. The ultrafiltration system is designed to provide a high flux rate and a long membrane life. The reverse osmosis system is designed to provide a high permeate quality and a long membrane life. Design parameters include filtration rate, backwash frequency, carbon dosage, transmembrane pressure, and salt rejection rate.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the sand filter is a multi-media filter with layers of sand, gravel, and anthracite. The activated carbon filter is a packed bed filter with granular activated carbon. The ultrafiltration system is a hollow fiber membrane system. The reverse osmosis system is a spiral wound membrane system. The sand filter is backwashed regularly to remove accumulated solids. The activated carbon is replaced periodically when its adsorption capacity is exhausted. The ultrafiltration membranes are cleaned regularly to remove foulants. The reverse osmosis membranes are cleaned and replaced periodically to maintain their performance. The treated water from the tertiary treatment system is stored in a storage tank and used for irrigation and other non-potable purposes.
    *   **Efficiency**: The tertiary treatment system is highly effective in removing remaining pollutants from the wastewater. The expected removal efficiency for TSS is typically >99%, and the removal efficiency for BOD and COD is typically >95%. The ultrafiltration system effectively removes bacteria and viruses, producing a disinfected effluent. The reverse osmosis system effectively removes dissolved salts, producing a high-quality water suitable for reuse. The overall efficiency of the tertiary treatment system depends on the performance of each individual unit process. Regular monitoring and maintenance are essential to ensure optimal performance.

6.  **Disinfection** (UV/Chlorination):
    *   **Principle**: Disinfection is the final step in wastewater treatment aimed at inactivating pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, ensuring the treated effluent is safe for reuse or discharge. The primary principle of disinfection involves disrupting the cellular structure or metabolic processes of these microorganisms, rendering them incapable of reproduction and causing disease. Common disinfection methods include UV irradiation and chlorination. UV disinfection utilizes ultraviolet light to damage the DNA of microorganisms, preventing them from replicating. Chlorination involves adding chlorine compounds to the water, which react with cellular components and disrupt their function.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of a disinfection system takes into account factors such as the type and concentration of microorganisms present in the wastewater, the desired level of disinfection, and regulatory requirements. For UV disinfection systems, key design parameters include the UV light intensity, the contact time, and the water flow rate. The UV dose, measured in mJ/cm², is a critical factor, with higher doses required for more resistant microorganisms. For chlorination systems, the design considers the chlorine dosage, the contact time, the pH of the water, and the presence of organic matter. The chlorine dosage is typically expressed as mg/L, and the contact time is the amount of time the chlorine is allowed to react with the water.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the disinfection process involves UV irradiation. The treated effluent from the tertiary treatment system flows through a UV disinfection unit equipped with high-intensity UV lamps. The water is exposed to UV light for a specified contact time, typically several seconds. The UV lamps are regularly inspected and maintained to ensure optimal performance. The UV dose is monitored using UV sensors, and the system is automatically adjusted to maintain the desired disinfection level. The flow rate through the UV unit is carefully controlled to ensure adequate exposure to UV light. The UV system is housed in a dedicated enclosure to protect personnel from UV exposure.
    *   **Efficiency**: The efficiency of the disinfection process is measured by the reduction in the number of viable microorganisms in the treated effluent. UV disinfection can achieve a high level of disinfection, typically greater than 99.99% reduction in bacteria and viruses. The efficiency depends on factors such as the UV dose, the water clarity, and the presence of suspended solids. Chlorination can also achieve a high level of disinfection, but it can also produce disinfection byproducts (DBPs) that may be harmful to human health. The facility carefully monitors the disinfection process and takes steps to minimize the formation of DBPs.

### 7.8 Description of Sewage Treatment Plant (STP)

The Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) is designed to treat domestic wastewater generated from restrooms, canteens, and office areas within the facility. The treated water is then used for gardening purposes. The STP has a treatment capacity of 20 KLD and employs Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) technology. The following describes the different stages of the STP:

1.  **Collection & Equalization**:

    *   **Principle**: Raw sewage is collected from various sources within the facility and directed to a collection tank. The primary principle of this stage is to provide temporary storage for the sewage and to dampen fluctuations in flow rate and pollutant concentration. This ensures a more consistent flow to the downstream treatment processes, preventing shock loading and optimizing their performance. The equalization process also helps to homogenize the sewage characteristics, such as pH and temperature, which is beneficial for the subsequent biological treatment.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The collection tank is designed to provide sufficient hydraulic retention time (HRT) to dampen flow variations. The typical HRT ranges from 4 to 8 hours, depending on the size of the facility and the variability of the sewage flow. The tank volume is calculated based on the peak flow rate and the desired HRT. The tank is typically equipped with a coarse screen to remove large debris and prevent clogging of downstream equipment. The design also includes provisions for odor control, such as a covered tank and ventilation system. Level sensors are installed to monitor the liquid level and prevent overflow.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, raw sewage is collected from various sources and directed to a 10 KL collection tank. The tank provides approximately 4 hours of retention time. The tank is equipped with a coarse screen to remove large debris. The liquid level in the tank is monitored by a level sensor. The sewage is then pumped from the collection tank to the screen chamber.
    *   **Efficiency**: The collection and equalization stage does not directly remove pollutants, but it improves the overall treatment efficiency by stabilizing the sewage characteristics. It prevents overloading of downstream treatment units and improves the performance of biological treatment processes. The removal of large debris by the coarse screen also protects downstream equipment from clogging and damage. Proper operation of the collection and equalization stage can lead to a 10-15% improvement in the overall STP efficiency.

2.  **Screen Chamber**:

    *   **Principle**: The screen chamber is a physical treatment unit designed to remove large solids and debris from the raw sewage. The principle is to pass the sewage through a screen with specific openings, trapping solid materials larger than the screen size. This protects downstream equipment from clogging, damage, and reduced efficiency. The removal of solids also reduces the organic load on the subsequent biological treatment processes.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the screen chamber includes selecting an appropriate screen size, determining the screen area, and providing access for cleaning and maintenance. The screen size is typically in the range of 6 to 25 mm, depending on the type of solids present in the sewage and the requirements of downstream equipment. The screen area is calculated based on the peak flow rate and the desired approach velocity. The screen chamber should be easily accessible for manual or automatic cleaning. The design also includes a bypass channel in case of screen blockage.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the screen chamber is equipped with a manually cleaned bar screen with 10 mm openings. The screen is cleaned daily to remove accumulated solids. The solids removed from the screen are collected and disposed of properly.
    *   **Efficiency**: The screen chamber is effective in removing large solids and debris from the raw sewage. The removal efficiency depends on the screen size and the amount of solids present in the sewage. A well-designed and operated screen chamber can remove up to 90% of the large solids, protecting downstream equipment and reducing the organic load on the biological treatment processes.

3.  **Oil & Grease Trap**:

    *   **Principle**: The oil and grease trap, if applicable, is designed to remove oil, grease, and fats from the sewage. The principle is based on the density difference between oil/grease and water. Oil and grease, being lighter than water, float to the surface and are trapped in the trap, preventing them from entering downstream treatment units. The presence of oil and grease can interfere with biological treatment processes and cause clogging of equipment.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the oil and grease trap includes determining the trap volume, providing sufficient retention time, and incorporating baffles to prevent oil and grease from escaping. The trap volume is calculated based on the peak flow rate and the desired retention time. The retention time is typically in the range of 20 to 30 minutes. Baffles are used to create a quiescent zone where oil and grease can separate from the water. The design also includes access for cleaning and removal of the accumulated oil and grease.
    *   **Operational Details**: Data Not Available
    *   **Efficiency**: Data Not Available.

4.  **Anaerobic/Settling Tank**:

    *   **Principle**: The anaerobic/settling tank is an optional pre-treatment unit that provides anaerobic digestion and settling of solids. The anaerobic digestion process breaks down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, reducing the organic load on downstream treatment processes. The settling process allows heavier solids to settle to the bottom of the tank, further reducing the suspended solids concentration.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the anaerobic/settling tank includes determining the tank volume, providing sufficient retention time, and incorporating sludge collection and removal systems. The tank volume is calculated based on the organic loading rate and the desired retention time. The retention time is typically in the range of 12 to 24 hours. The design also includes a sludge collection hopper and a sludge removal system.
    *   **Operational Details**: Data Not Available.
    *   **Efficiency**: Data Not Available.

5.  **Biological Treatment (MBBR, Aeration)**:

    *   **Principle**: Biological treatment is the core of the STP, utilizing microorganisms to remove dissolved organic pollutants from the sewage. The Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) technology is a type of attached growth biological treatment that uses plastic carriers as a substrate for the growth of microorganisms. The carriers are suspended in the aeration tank and provide a large surface area for biofilm development. The microorganisms in the biofilm consume the organic matter in the sewage, converting it into carbon dioxide, water, and new biomass. The aeration tank provides oxygen to the microorganisms, which is essential for their metabolic activity. The MBBR process offers several advantages over conventional activated sludge processes, including higher biomass concentration, better sludge settling characteristics, and greater resistance to shock loads.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the MBBR system includes determining the aeration tank volume, the carrier fill ratio, the aeration rate, and the secondary clarifier size. The aeration tank volume is calculated based on the organic loading rate and the desired removal efficiency. The carrier fill ratio is typically 30-50% of the tank volume. The aeration rate is determined based on the oxygen demand of the microorganisms. The secondary clarifier is designed to provide sufficient surface area and detention time for the biomass to settle out. The design also includes carrier retention screens to prevent the carriers from escaping the aeration tank.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the MBBR system consists of an aeration tank filled with plastic carriers. The aeration tank is equipped with a diffused aeration system. The aeration system consists of a blower that supplies air to a network of diffusers located at the bottom of the tank. The diffusers release fine bubbles of air into the sewage, providing oxygen for the microorganisms. The treated sewage then flows to a secondary clarifier for biomass settling.
    *   **Efficiency**: The MBBR system is highly effective in removing dissolved organic pollutants from the sewage. The expected removal efficiency for BOD is typically 85-95%, and the removal efficiency for COD is typically 75-85%. The efficiency of the MBBR system depends on the operating conditions, such as the aeration rate, the carrier fill ratio, and the organic loading rate. Factors that can affect the efficiency include the sewage temperature, the pH, the nutrient availability, and the presence of toxic substances.

6.  **Secondary Clarifier (sludge settling)**:

    *   **Principle**: The secondary clarifier is a sedimentation tank that allows the biomass (sludge) from the MBBR to settle out of the treated water. The principle is based on gravity settling, where the heavier biomass particles settle to the bottom of the tank, producing a clear effluent. The settled sludge is then either recycled back to the aeration tank to maintain a high biomass concentration or removed for further treatment or disposal.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the secondary clarifier includes determining the clarifier size, providing sufficient surface area and detention time, and incorporating sludge collection and removal systems. The clarifier size is calculated based on the peak flow rate and the desired settling velocity. The detention time is typically in the range of 2 to 4 hours. The design also includes a sludge collection hopper and a sludge removal system.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the secondary clarifier is a circular tank with a center feed and a peripheral overflow weir. The hydraulic retention time in the secondary clarifier is typically 3-4 hours. The settled sludge is removed using a scraper mechanism that continuously sweeps the sludge to a central hopper. A portion of the sludge is recycled back to the aeration tank, while the excess sludge is wasted to a sludge thickener.
    *   **Efficiency**: The secondary clarifier is effective in removing biomass from the treated water. The expected removal efficiency for TSS is typically 80-90%. The efficiency of the secondary clarifier depends on the settling characteristics of the sludge and the hydraulic loading rate. Factors that can affect the efficiency include the sludge volume index (SVI), the temperature, and the presence of turbulence.

7.  **Tertiary Treatment (PSF, ACF, Disinfection)**:

    *   **Principle**: Tertiary treatment is the final stage of the STP, designed to remove any remaining pollutants and produce a high-quality effluent suitable for reuse. The tertiary treatment system at this facility includes a combination of pressure sand filter (PSF), activated carbon filter (ACF), and disinfection. The PSF removes any remaining suspended solids that were not removed in the previous treatment stages. The ACF removes dissolved organic compounds, color, and odor. Disinfection kills any remaining pathogens in the treated water.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the tertiary treatment system includes selecting appropriate filter media, determining the filter size, and selecting an appropriate disinfection method. The sand filter is designed to provide a high filtration rate and a long filter run time. The activated carbon filter is designed to provide a high adsorption capacity and a long carbon life. The disinfection system is designed to provide adequate disinfection to kill any remaining pathogens.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the PSF is a vertical pressure filter with layers of sand and gravel. The ACF is a vertical pressure filter with granular activated carbon. Disinfection is achieved using chlorination. The treated water from the tertiary treatment system is stored in a storage tank and used for gardening.
    *   **Efficiency**: The tertiary treatment system is highly effective in removing remaining pollutants from the sewage. The expected removal efficiency for TSS is typically >99%, and the removal efficiency for BOD and COD is typically >95%. Disinfection effectively kills any remaining pathogens, producing a high-quality water suitable for reuse.

8.  **Treated Water Storage** (pumped for gardening):

    *   **Principle**: The treated water storage tank provides a buffer between the STP and the irrigation system. The tank allows for the storage of treated water during periods of low irrigation demand and provides a consistent supply of water to the irrigation system during periods of high demand.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the treated water storage tank includes determining the tank volume and providing a pumping system to deliver the water to the irrigation system. The tank volume is calculated based on the average daily irrigation demand and the storage capacity required. The pumping system is designed to deliver the water at the required flow rate and pressure.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the treated water is stored in a 5 KL storage tank. The water is pumped from the storage tank to the irrigation system using a centrifugal pump.
    *   **Efficiency**: The treated water storage tank ensures a consistent supply of water to the irrigation system, even during periods of fluctuating demand.

9.  **Sludge Handling** (dewatering, disposal):

    *   **Principle**: Sludge handling involves the treatment and disposal of the sludge generated during the sewage treatment process. The sludge is a concentrated mixture of organic matter, microorganisms, and other solids. Sludge handling processes aim to reduce the volume of the sludge, stabilize the organic matter, and eliminate pathogens before disposal. Common sludge handling processes include thickening, dewatering, and disposal. Thickening reduces the water content of the sludge, increasing its solids concentration. Dewatering further reduces the water content of the sludge, producing a solid or semi-solid material. Disposal options include land application, landfill disposal, and incineration.
    *   **Design Criteria**: The design of the sludge handling system includes selecting appropriate thickening and dewatering technologies, determining the required sludge storage capacity, and selecting an appropriate disposal method. The selection of thickening and dewatering technologies depends on the characteristics of the sludge and the desired solids content. The sludge storage capacity is calculated based on the sludge generation rate and the frequency of disposal. The selection of a disposal method depends on the local regulations and the characteristics of the sludge.
    *   **Operational Details**: At this facility, the sludge is thickened using a sludge thickener. The thickened sludge is then dewatered using a belt filter press. The dewatered sludge is disposed of at a permitted landfill.
    *   **Efficiency**: The sludge handling system reduces the volume of the sludge, stabilizes the organic matter, and eliminates pathogens, making it safe for disposal. The efficiency of the sludge handling system depends on the performance of the thickening and dewatering processes.

The wastewater generation data indicates a slight increase in annual generation from 20,368 KL in 2023-24 to 20,513 KL in 2024-25. The ETP and STP employ advanced treatment technologies to ensure that the treated effluent meets the prescribed discharge standards. The recycled water usage for gardening and floor washing significantly reduces the demand for fresh water. A detailed analysis of the treatment process efficiency would provide insights into the effectiveness of the ETP and STP in removing pollutants.

### 8.5 Specific Water Consumption (SWC)

**Table: Specific Water Consumption (SWC)**

| Year             | SWC (Liters/Bottle) |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Previous Year    | 2.2                 |
| Last Year        | 2.1                 |
| Current Year     | 2.0                 |
| Industry Benchmark | 1.8                 |

Ltd.'s water usage patterns, water quality, wastewater generation and treatment, and water conservation initiatives. The primary water source is groundwater, extracted through two borewells, and the approved groundwater withdrawal limit is 100 KLD as per CGWA. The groundwater is pre-treated using a Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant to meet the stringent water quality requirements for pharmaceutical manufacturing. The analysis of groundwater quality indicates that the pH is within permissible limits, while the TDS is slightly elevated. Regular monitoring of the groundwater quality and levels is crucial to ensure sustainable extraction and prevent aquifer depletion.

Wastewater generation for the audit period was 20,368 KL (2023-24), 20,513 KL (2024-25). The facility has implemented an Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) with a capacity of 100 KLD, utilizing primary, secondary (ASP), and tertiary (RO/UF) treatment technologies. A Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) with a capacity of 20 KLD and MBBR technology is also in place to treat domestic wastewater. A portion of the treated wastewater is recycled for gardening and floor washing, reducing the demand for fresh water. Improving the efficiency of the wastewater treatment processes is crucial for maximizing water reuse and minimizing environmental impact.

The Specific Water Consumption (SWC) has shown a decreasing trend over the past three years, from 2.2 liters/bottle to 2.0 liters/bottle. However, the current SWC is still slightly higher than the industry benchmark of 1.8 liters/bottle, suggesting room for further optimization. Regular leak audits, staff training, and the reuse of ETP treated water for gardening are among the water conservation initiatives implemented. The identified potential water savings measures, such as reject water recovery from the RO plant, condensate recovery from the boiler, installation of aerators in taps, and the use of treated STP water for the green belt, could result in significant reductions in water consumption.

The long-term implications of the observed data trends highlight the importance of proactive water management strategies. Continued reliance on groundwater as the primary water source poses a risk of aquifer depletion and potential water scarcity, especially given the increasing demand for water in the region.

### 9.2.1 Detailed Feasibility Analysis for EACH Measure

#### 9.2.1.1 Industrial Process (WFI): Reject Water Recovery from RO Plant

**Technical Feasibility:**

The recovery of reject water from the Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant used in the production of Water for Injection (WFI) is technically feasible and offers significant water conservation potential. RO systems typically reject a substantial portion of the feed water as concentrate, which, although unsuitable for WFI, can be treated and reused for other applications within the facility. Implementing this requires a comprehensive assessment of the reject water quality, selection of appropriate treatment technology, and integration with the existing water distribution network.

1.  **Reject Water Characterization:** The first step is to thoroughly analyze the reject water from the RO plant. This includes measuring parameters such as Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), pH, conductivity, silica content, and microbial load. This data is crucial for selecting the appropriate treatment process. The standard method for TDS measurement is IS 3025 Part 16. The acceptable TDS level must adhere to IS 10500:2012 (Drinking Water Specification) standards, but for non-potable use, this can be adjusted based on end-use requirements.

2.  **Treatment Technology Selection:** Based on the reject water characteristics, various treatment technologies can be considered, including:
    *   **Ultrafiltration (UF):** UF can remove suspended solids, colloids, and microorganisms, improving the water quality for further treatment. UF systems typically operate at a pressure of 1-7 bar and have a pore size of 0.01-0.1 μm.
    *   **Reverse Osmosis (RO):** A second stage of RO can further reduce the TDS and other contaminants, making the water suitable for less demanding applications, such as cooling tower makeup or equipment washing. Second-stage RO systems operate at pressures of 15-25 bar.
    *   **Electrodeionization (EDI):** EDI can be used to polish the RO permeate and remove remaining ionic contaminants, providing high-purity water. EDI systems require a DC power supply and operate at voltages between 24 and 48 VDC.
    *   **Chemical Treatment:** Chlorination or UV disinfection can be used to eliminate any remaining microorganisms. UV disinfection systems should provide a UV dose of at least 30 mJ/cm².

3.  **Integration with Water Network:** After treatment, the recovered water needs to be integrated into the existing water distribution network. This involves installing new piping, pumps, and storage tanks. A dedicated storage tank is recommended to ensure a consistent supply of recovered water. The piping material should be compatible with the treated water quality to prevent corrosion. HDPE or stainless steel are commonly used.

4.  **Automation and Control:** Automated control systems are essential to ensure the reliable and efficient operation of the reject water recovery system. This includes sensors to monitor water quality, flow rates, and pressure, as well as control valves and pumps to regulate the water flow. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are typically used for automation.

**Economic Analysis:**

The economic feasibility of RO reject water recovery depends on several factors, including the volume of reject water, the cost of treatment, and the price of fresh water.

1.  **Capital Cost:** The capital cost includes the cost of the treatment equipment (UF, RO, EDI, disinfection), piping, pumps, storage tanks, and automation systems. For a 5 KLD RO reject recovery system, the estimated capital cost is:
    *   UF System: INR 5,00,000
    *   RO System: INR 10,00,000
    *   EDI System: INR 15,00,000
    *   Piping, Pumps, and Storage: INR 5,00,000
    *   Automation System: INR 2,00,000
    *   **Total Capital Cost: INR 37,00,000**

2.  **Operating Cost:** The operating cost includes the cost of electricity, chemicals, membrane replacement, and labor.
    *   Electricity Cost: The electricity consumption of the pumps and treatment equipment is estimated at 10 kWh per day. Assuming an electricity cost of INR 8 per kWh, the daily electricity cost is INR 80. The annual electricity cost is INR 80 * 365 = INR 29,200.
    *   Chemical Cost: The cost of chemicals (e.g., antiscalants, biocides) is estimated at INR 10,000 per year.
    *   Membrane Replacement: The RO membranes need to be replaced every 3-5 years. The cost of membrane replacement is estimated at INR 2,00,000 every 4 years, or INR 50,000 per year.
    *   Labor Cost: The labor cost for operating and maintaining the system is estimated at INR 1,00,000 per year.
    *   **Total Operating Cost: INR 1,89,200 per year**

3.  **Savings:** The savings are based on the volume of water recovered and the price of fresh water. Assuming a water price of INR 50 per kL, the annual savings are:
    *   Savings: 1825 kL/year * INR 50/kL = INR 91,250 per year

4.  **Return on Investment (ROI):**
    *   ROI = (Annual Savings - Annual Operating Cost) / Capital Cost
    *   ROI = (INR 91,250 - INR 1,89,200) / INR 37,00,000 = -0.026 (or -2.6%)

5.  **Payback Period:** Since the ROI is negative, there is no payback period. This implies that the economic feasibility of this measure is questionable under the current assumptions.

**Formula Used:**

*   ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) * 100
*   Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Inflow

**Environmental Impact:**

The recovery of RO reject water has a positive environmental impact by reducing the demand for fresh water and minimizing the discharge of wastewater. However, the treatment process also consumes energy and chemicals, which can have negative environmental impacts. A full lifecycle assessment is required to quantify the net environmental benefit.

Compliance with CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) guidelines for wastewater discharge is mandatory.

#### 9.2.1.2 Utility (Boiler): Condensate Recovery System

**Technical Feasibility:**

Implementing a condensate recovery system for boilers is a highly effective water and energy conservation measure. Condensate, which is essentially distilled water, can be returned to the boiler feedwater tank, reducing the need for fresh water and lowering the energy required to heat the feedwater.

1.  **Condensate Collection:** The first step is to collect the condensate from various steam-using equipment in the facility. This includes steam traps, heat exchangers, and other process equipment. The condensate collection system should be designed to minimize contamination. Steam traps should be properly maintained to prevent steam leakage, which reduces the amount of condensate available for recovery. Regular maintenance should follow IS 12362:1988 guidelines.

2.  **Condensate Treatment:** The recovered condensate may contain contaminants such as oil, iron, and other impurities. Treatment is necessary to remove these contaminants before the condensate can be reused as boiler feedwater. Treatment technologies include:
    *   **Filtration:** Filtration can remove suspended solids and other particulate matter. Sand filters or cartridge filters are commonly used.
    *   **Oil Removal:** Oil separators or coalescing filters can be used to remove oil from the condensate.
    *   **Chemical Treatment:** Chemical treatment can be used to adjust the pH and remove dissolved gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. Oxygen scavengers are used to prevent corrosion in the boiler system.

3.  **Condensate Return:** The treated condensate is returned to the boiler feedwater tank. This requires installing new piping and pumps. The piping material should be compatible with the condensate quality to prevent corrosion. Stainless steel or copper piping is commonly used.

4.  **Monitoring and Control:** A monitoring and control system is essential to ensure the reliable and efficient operation of the condensate recovery system. This includes sensors to monitor condensate quality, flow rates, and temperature, as well as control valves and pumps to regulate the condensate flow. The system should be equipped with alarms to alert operators of any problems.

**Economic Analysis:**

The economic feasibility of a condensate recovery system depends on several factors, including the volume of condensate recovered, the cost of treatment, and the cost of fresh water and energy.

1.  **Capital Cost:** The capital cost includes the cost of the condensate collection system, treatment equipment, piping, pumps, and monitoring and control system. For a 2 KLD condensate recovery system, the estimated capital cost is:
    *   Condensate Collection System: INR 2,00,000
    *   Treatment Equipment: INR 3,00,000
    *   Piping and Pumps: INR 2,00,000
    *   Monitoring and Control System: INR 1,00,000
    *   **Total Capital Cost: INR 8,00,000**

2.  **Operating Cost:** The operating cost includes the cost of electricity, chemicals, and labor.
    *   Electricity Cost: The electricity consumption of the pumps and treatment equipment is estimated at 5 kWh per day. Assuming an electricity cost of INR 8 per kWh, the daily electricity cost is INR 40. The annual electricity cost is INR 40 * 365 = INR 14,600.
    *   Chemical Cost: The cost of chemicals is estimated at INR 5,000 per year.
    *   Labor Cost: The labor cost for operating and maintaining the system is estimated at INR 50,000 per year.
    *   **Total Operating Cost: INR 69,600 per year**

3.  **Savings:** The savings are based on the volume of water recovered and the energy saved by using hot condensate as boiler feedwater. Assuming a water price of INR 50 per kL and an energy saving of 10% due to using hot condensate, the annual savings are:
    *   Water Savings: 730 kL/year * INR 50/kL = INR 36,500
    *   Energy Savings: Assuming the boiler consumes 1000 GJ of energy per year at a cost of INR 500 per GJ, the energy savings are 1000 GJ * 10% * INR 500/GJ = INR 50,000
    *   **Total Savings: INR 86,500 per year**

4.  **Return on Investment (ROI):**
    *   ROI = (Annual Savings - Annual Operating Cost) / Capital Cost
    *   ROI = (INR 86,500 - INR 69,600) / INR 8,00,000 = 0.021 (or 2.1%)

5.  **Payback Period:**
    *   Payback Period = Initial Investment / (Annual Savings - Annual Operating Cost)
    *   Payback Period = INR 8,00,000 / (INR 86,500 - INR 69,600) = 47.3 years

**Formula Used:**

*   ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) * 100
*   Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Inflow

**Environmental Impact:**

The condensate recovery system has a positive environmental impact by reducing the demand for fresh water and saving energy. This reduces the emissions associated with water treatment and energy production. The chemical usage should be optimized to minimize environmental impact.

#### 9.2.1.3 Domestic Water Use: Install Aerators in Taps

**Technical Feasibility:**

Installing aerators in taps is a simple and cost-effective way to reduce water consumption in domestic applications. Aerators mix air with water, reducing the flow rate without compromising water pressure.

1.  **Aerator Selection:** Aerators are available in various flow rates, ranging from 0.5 gpm (1.9 lpm) to 1.5 gpm (5.7 lpm). The appropriate flow rate depends on the application and user preference. For handwashing, a flow rate of 1.0 gpm (3.8 lpm) is typically sufficient. The aerators must comply with IS 900:1992 - Specification for Non-automatic flushing cisterns.

2.  **Installation:** Aerators can be easily installed in most taps. The existing tap nozzle is removed, and the aerator is screwed in its place. No special tools are required.

3.  **Maintenance:** Aerators may require periodic cleaning to remove mineral deposits and debris. The aerator can be easily removed and cleaned with a brush or vinegar solution.

**Economic Analysis:**

The economic feasibility of installing aerators depends on the cost of the aerators and the price of fresh water.

1.  **Capital Cost:** The cost of aerators is relatively low. A good quality aerator costs around INR 100. Assuming 50 taps are fitted with aerators, the total capital cost is:
    *   Total Capital Cost: 50 taps * INR 100/tap = INR 5,000

2.  **Operating Cost:** The operating cost is negligible.

3.  **Savings:** The savings are based on the volume of water saved. Assuming that each tap is used for 5 minutes per day and that the aerator reduces the flow rate by 50%, the annual savings are:
    *   Water Savings per Tap: 5 minutes/day * 0.5 gpm * 365 days/year = 912.5 gallons/year = 3.45 kL/year
    *   Total Water Savings: 50 taps * 3.45 kL/year = 172.5 kL/year (Given: 182.5 kL/year)
    *   Assuming a water price of INR 50 per kL, the annual savings are: 182.5 kL/year * INR 50/kL = INR 9,125

4.  **Return on Investment (ROI):**
    *   ROI = (Annual Savings - Annual Operating Cost) / Capital Cost
    *   ROI = (INR 9,125 - 0) / INR 5,000 = 1.825 (or 182.5%)

5.  **Payback Period:**
    *   Payback Period = Initial Investment / (Annual Savings - Annual Operating Cost)
    *   Payback Period = INR 5,000 / INR 9,125 = 0.55 years (or 6.6 months)

**Formula Used:**

*   ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) * 100
*   Payback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Inflow

**Environmental Impact:**

Installing aerators has a positive environmental impact by reducing the demand for fresh water. The manufacturing of aerators has some environmental impact, but this is relatively small compared to the water savings.

#### 9.2.1.4 Green Belt: Use Treated STP Water

**Technical Feasibility:**

Using treated Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) water for green belt irrigation is a sustainable water management practice. It reduces the demand for fresh water and provides nutrients for plant growth.

1.  **STP Effluent Quality:** The STP effluent quality must be suitable for irrigation. This includes measuring parameters such as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and fecal coliform. The treated water must adhere to CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board) guidelines for irrigation.

2.  **Irrigation System:** The irrigation system should be designed to minimize water loss and ensure uniform distribution. Drip irrigation or sprinkler irrigation are commonly used. Drip irrigation is more efficient as it delivers water directly to the plant roots.

3.  **Storage:** A storage tank may be required to store the treated STP water before it is used for irrigation. The storage tank should be covered to prevent evaporation and contamination.

4.  **Piping and Pumps:** Piping and pumps are required to transport the treated STP water from the STP to the green belt. The piping material should be compatible with the treated water quality to prevent corrosion.

**Economic Analysis:**

The economic feasibility of using treated STP water for green belt irrigation depends on the cost of the STP, the cost of the irrigation system, and the price of fresh water.

1.  **Capital Cost:** The capital cost includes the cost of the STP, the irrigation system, the storage tank, and the piping and pumps. The STP capital costs are excluded in this analysis, as it is assumed to be already in place. For a 5 KLD STP water reuse system for green belt, the estimated capital cost is:
    *   Irrigation System: INR 3,00,000
    *   Storage Tank: INR 2,00,000
    *   Piping and Pumps: INR 1,00,000
    *   **Total Capital Cost: INR 6,00,000**

2.  **Operating Cost:** The operating cost includes the cost of electricity and labor.

    *   Labor Cost: The labor cost for operating and maintaining the system is estimated at INR 30,000 per year.
    *   **Total Operating Cost: INR 38,760 per year**

3.  **Savings:** The savings are based on the volume of water saved.
    *   Water Savings: 1825 kL/year
    *   Assuming a water price of INR 50 per kL, the annual savings are: 1825 kL/year * INR 50/kL = INR 91,250

4.  **Return on Investment (ROI):**
    *   ROI = (Annual Savings - Annual Operating Cost) / Capital Cost
    *   ROI = (INR 91,250 - INR 38,760) / INR 6,00,000 = 0.087 (or 8.7%)

5.  **Payback Period:**
    *   Payback Period = Initial Investment / (Annual Savings - Annual Operating Cost)

Here is Chapter 10 of the Water Audit Report for Abaris Healthcare Pvt. Ltd., adhering to the specified guidelines and incorporating all provided data.

**Chapter 10: Conclusion**

**10.1 Overview of Audit Context**

This comprehensive water audit report, numbered CAH/WAR/2025/001 and conducted by Climate AI Hub Auditing Services under the direction of Dr. Dhaval Patel, Certificate Number W-2025-001, examines the water usage and management practices of Abaris Healthcare Pvt. Ltd., located in Rajpur, Mehsana, Gujarat, for the period of analysis spanning 2023-24 to 2024-25. This audit is driven by the regulatory requirements stipulated by the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) concerning industries abstracting groundwater exceeding 100 m³/day, in accordance with CGWA Number CGWA/NOC/IND/REN/1/2021/6589 and CGWA Application Number 21-4/6890/GJ/IND/2022. The primary objective was to quantify water consumption across the facility, identify areas of water loss and inefficiency, and propose viable water-saving opportunities. The audit employed a rigorous methodology, involving detailed data collection, on-site measurements, process analysis, and a systematic evaluation of existing water management practices, referencing the "STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE for Preparation of Water Audit Report and its Evaluation Criteria (August 2024)".

**10.2 Key Findings and Observations**

The water audit revealed several key aspects of Abaris Healthcare Pvt. Ltd.'s water management:

*   **Process Water Usage:** A significant portion of the facility's water consumption is attributed to process requirements, particularly the Water for Injection (WFI) system, accounting for 40% of the total water usage. The Specific Water Consumption (SWC) was measured at 2.0 liters/bottle, slightly above the industry benchmark of 1.8 liters/bottle, indicating potential for optimization within the manufacturing processes.
*   **Technology Assessment:** The assessment of Best Available Technologies (BAT) revealed gaps in certain areas. The existing WFI generation system, relying on double-pass RO and multi-column distillation, lags behind the more efficient membrane-based cold WFI systems. Similarly, while automatic Fill-Finish-Seal (FFS) machines are in use, the inclusion of Isolator/RABS and CIP/SIP systems could enhance sterility and reduce contamination risks, aligning closer with BAT. Insufficient data was provided for the Cooling Tower and Boiler systems to conduct BAT gap analysis.
*   **Wastewater Management:** The facility generates approximately 20,368 KL to 20,513 KL of wastewater annually, treated through a combination of an ETP (100 KLD capacity) and an STP (20 KLD capacity). Treated wastewater is recycled for gardening, green belt irrigation, and floor washing. While the treatment processes appear adequate, improvements in ETP efficiency and expansion of the water reuse program could further reduce reliance on fresh water sources.
*   **Data Analysis Insights:** Analysis of water consumption data highlighted opportunities for improved water management. While water conservation initiatives like regular leak audits and staff training are in place, the data emphasized the need for a more comprehensive water management plan to ensure long-term sustainability and resilience.

**10.3 Water Conservation Strategy**

Based on the audit findings, a detailed water conservation strategy was developed, encompassing area-specific measures and feasibility analyses. Key proposed measures include:

*   RO reject water recovery from the WFI generation process.
*   Implementation of a condensate recovery system for the boiler.
*   Installation of aerators in domestic water outlets.
*   Expanded use of treated STP water for green belt irrigation.

The total potential water savings from implementing these measures are estimated at **12.5 KLD**, translating to **4562.5 kL/year**, with varying degrees of economic feasibility. Domestic water aerators had the highest ROI, while the boiler condensate recovery gave the least ROI.

**10.4 Final Conclusion**

In conclusion, while Abaris Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. has made strides in water management, as demonstrated by its existing water recycling and conservation initiatives, there remains significant potential to enhance water use efficiency and reduce groundwater dependency. The current SWC being slightly higher than the industry benchmark means there is still room for SWC reduction. Based on the analysis conducted by Climate AI Hub, Abaris Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. should take action to comply with CGWA guidelines for groundwater extraction, and strive to reduce water consumption by 20% over three years. This can be achieved by implementing the proposed water conservation measures outlined in this report, along with continuous monitoring, optimization of existing technologies, and embracing Best Available Technologies. The implementation of these measures is crucial not only for reducing operational costs and meeting regulatory requirements but also for fostering a commitment to environmental stewardship and achieving long-term sustainability in water resource management.
